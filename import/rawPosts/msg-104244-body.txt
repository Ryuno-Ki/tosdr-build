I think that this is a fairly standard clause, and given that 'reasonable=
=20
belief' is a standard of law in the United States, I feel their ability to=
=20
inform in the event of perceived harm to someone is a good thing. It's=20
similar to therapists and lawyers: they cannot disclose anything except in=
=20
the case they believe their client to be a danger to themselves or others.

This point has been noted and will be appearing on the website within a few=
=20
days.
