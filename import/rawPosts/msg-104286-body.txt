talking about "content" that you "submit" as part of a review of a product.=
  That=20
could be text or a photo of the product. =20

Amazon also operates a "cloud" on which (for rental money) one can store=20
data and applications.  It is not clear without further reading whether put=
ting=20
data or even custom software out in their cloud is covered.  That needs=20
clarification.
