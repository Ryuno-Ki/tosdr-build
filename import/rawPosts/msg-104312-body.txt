Hello everyone,

In order to meet the standards of transparency which are appropriate for
this project, here's my monthly report for my participation to ToS;DR.

      * November 3rd: finances (we're investigating what's the best
        formal or informal way to deal with the projects' finance since
        the crowdfunding. We're basically looking in whether we should
        set up a legal person with a French reg. association (loi 1901)
        or if just non reg. association might work (also loi 1901).
        We're also looking at what's the best way to deal with
        contributors who get a remuneration for the work they do on the
        project (what kind of contract, what kind of tax status, etc.)
        and where would the money come from (we might get some help from
        FDNN: a French fund managing financial aspects for associations
        dealing with digital freedoms).
      * 10th & 11th: talk at FSCONS, in Goteborg
      * I've also started working on a new kind of way for people to
        contribute to the project. See
        https://github.com/didnotread/didnotread.org/issues?state=open
        #46 47 48 and 49 and
        https://github.com/didnotread/didnotread.org/tree/gh-pages/point
      * 13th: I'm launching a sister-project for France with law
        students at Sciences Po. So I have to work with the existing
        associations and convince the university administration to
        support the project, and also find motivated students to work on
        it.
      * 14th: working on the version 2 of the website, and writing a
        report (see http://tos-dr.info/blog/ )
      * 15th: working with Ian to explain how to make the data points
        from the mailing list (researching the terms', analysing them,
        comparing with topics from existing points, writing style for
        the data, formatting etc)
      * 16th: worked on several data points (don't remember which, but
        this can be checkd on the changelog at
        https://github.com/didnotread/didnotread.org/ )
      * 17th: gave a talk at Paris' Ubuntu Party
      * 19th: working on the website and the blog
      * 20th: working on a new interface proposal (see
        https://github.com/didnotread/didnotread.org/tree/gh-pages/point
        )

Total Time logged: 26,7 hours
Advocacy and communication: ~6 hours
Tools Development: ~3 hours
  + Website version 2: ~5 hours
Governance (report, blog, transparency): ~6 hours
Data points: ~4 hours

About the perks from Indiegogo, Michiel and Jan will give you an update
