Hi,

Somebody sent this with the feedback widget on the website. It's a bit
difficult to assess because mobile carriers contracts are national. But
it's informational any way.

Best,
Hugo

Sujet: New feedback for "Terms of Service; Didn=92t Read"

Hi hugo,

you received new feedback for your app "Terms of Service; Didn=92t Read":

> I pay my T-Mobile cell phone bill on line each month. The TOS agreement
> recites, near the end: "T-Mobile reserves the right to change these terms=
 and
> conditions at any time. Notice of any such change may be given..." I sugg=
ested,
> in a phone call to them, that they could at least include a date for the =
posted
> TOS - so I won't have to actually read the darned thing each month. Well,=
 it's
> too easy a solution, of course, so they have ignored me. But lately they =
have
> at least included a "Version" number. I actually do read these things, mo=
st of
> the time, although it partly depends on whose TOS it is. Maybe you could =
put a
> little pressure on someone somewhere, although I'm sure they are content =
that
> most folks do not read the TOSs.
