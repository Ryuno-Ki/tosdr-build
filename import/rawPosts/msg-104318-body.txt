Hey all,

  I'm not sure if this is usually how you like to receive TOS/Privacy=20
Policy reviews; but I had some time and decided to dissect and run through=
=20
the entire Envato privacy policy, user terms of service and member terms of=
=20
service. All three I placed into a SkyDrive document (=20
https://skydrive.live.com/#!/view.aspx?cid=3DB84C72D186B56A8A&resid=3DB84C7=
2D186B56A8A%21587&app=3DWord=20
) with my notes, which I'll summarize here. Hopefully we can discuss all=20
the points and folks who know more than I do about the process and massage=
=20
the data into something useful for ToS;DR.

The domains this terms apply to are:

   - activeden.net=20
   - audiojungle.net=20
   - codecanyon.net=20
   - graphicriver.net=20
   - themeforest.net=20
   - videohive.net=20
   - 3docean.net=20
   - tutsplus.com=20
   - photodune.net
  =20
Here are the main highlights I was able to extract (see the SkyDrive=20
document for where each of these comes from in the legal documents):

=20

   removal.
   32. WARNING You agree to help defend Evanto against third-party claims.
   33. WARNING Third party cookies are used for advertising
   34. WARNING Data may be stored anywhere without given notice.
  =20
I know this is a massive amount, and I'm sorry if this isn't the typical=20
way of doing things (I've only posted once before, so, feedback is VERY=20
helpful in knowing how and where to focus my energy). Looking forward to=20
input!
