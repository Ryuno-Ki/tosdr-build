Hi Robin,

First off, let me say thanks, this is a ton of data and I'm sure we'll have=
=20
some good discussions about each of the points.=20

However, for the purposes of facilitating those discussions, it is easier=
=20
if you limit your contributions to one thread per point. That way we don't=
=20
have multiple discussions occurring within the same thread, making it=20
difficult for me to extract the data points that have been discussed and=20
resolved.

Again, this is awesome, it looks like there is a lot of good data here, but=
=20
for the benefit of clarity within the discussions, one data point per=20
thread is preferred. Thanks!

Ian
