Hi Jil,

Wow, this looks great. Thanks for your contribution! Definitely a lot of=20
information here to consider and discuss! However, the reason we prefer one=
=20
thread per topic is to better facilitate discussions and not have multiple=
=20
discussions going on within the same thread. Gathering data from a thread=
=20
with multiple on-going discussions can be quite difficult, as you might=20
imagine.=20

That being said, we definitely appreciate what you've done here. But in the=
=20
future, if you could keep to the one thread per topic, that would be=20
preferred.

Thanks again!

Ian
