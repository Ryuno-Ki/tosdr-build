These two sites share the same privacy police (one<http://www.fightforthefuture.org/privacy/>, 
two <http://www.thecenterforrights.org/privacy>) and despite the first 
sentence of their privacy policy being "Fight for the Future is committed 
to protecting your privacy." they don't make much of an effort.

We may share your contact information with cooperating organizations or 
> service providers in order to facilitate email delivery, list management, 
> and for other purposes. We do not sell our email list.


This statement is phrased weakly enough that they can share your personal 
data with anyone, as long as they don't sell it to them. I find that rather 
disturbing. They also note that signing any petition will make your 
personal information a matter of public record and will share it with third 
parties.

So, on the one had, this is a petition site and having your name on a 
petition getting distributed should be rather obvious. On the other hand 
they are opening the door to hand-deliver this information to others and 
not warning users that there's no protection once they sign.
