At the very least, their T&C doesn't require them to. I see that as perhaps=
=20
a more important issue than the trial alone.

Should this be one negative point:

* Trail offers bill automatically at the end of the trial, subscription=20
fees may change any time without notice.

Or broken into two?

* Trail offers will be billed automatically at the end of the trail period=
=20
if not canceled before the end of the period.
* Subscription rates and fees may change at any time without notice.
