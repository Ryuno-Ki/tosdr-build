I can't help but notice it doesn't seem you commented on the blog post=20
itself? Have you tried any direct contact with 500px?

<br>Hi,
<br>
<br>Thanks for taking the time to communicate on this. &nbsp;Now allow me s=
ome
<br>quick comments:
<br>&gt; First and foremost, the photographer will always hold the copyrigh=
t of
<br>&gt; their work that was there prior to uploading. The photographer is =
in
<br>&gt; control of his or her photos and content.
<br>
<br>Yes. But the whole point is that with the copyright license in the
<br>terms, 500px also gets a very large control over the photographer's
<br>pictures, a control that expands way beyond the technical requirements
<br>for running the service.
<br>
<br>&gt; In our Terms of Service we use several fancy terms such as
<br>&gt; =93non-exclusive, transferable, worldwide license, reproduce, modi=
fy,
<br>&gt; adapt, publicly perform and publicly display, etc". In order to ho=
st,
<br>&gt; promote and crop your photos into thumbnails for various means lik=
e
<br>&gt; sharing on Facebook, Twitter and other social medias, we need
<br>&gt; permission from you to do so.
<br>
<br>That's typically where there is quite a broad difference between what
<br>the copyright license is and allows, compared to what 500px says it use=
s
<br>it for.
<br>
<br>As I explained on the thread related to this:
<br><a href=3D"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tosdr/X99SUnV7RUs/DL2qXYkRQU=
oJ" target=3D"_blank">https://groups.google.com/d/<wbr>msg/tosdr/X99SUnV7RU=
s/<wbr>DL2qXYkRQUoJ</a> the
<br>limitation is "arguably weak".=20
<br>
<br>It would be great if you could answer _precisely_ on that. I think the
<br>copyright license in 500px terms could really be improved if it
<br>reflected better how it is used by 500px and what users can do about it
<br>(after all, it is *their* photos).
<br>
<br>* * *
<br>
<br>On Changes, as you can see on <a href=3D"http://tos-dr.info/topics.html=
#changes" target=3D"_blank">http://tos-dr.info/topics.<wbr>html#changes</a>=
 a
<br>lot of other services give more time for users to review changes. We
<br>think this is important. If Google or Soundcloud can do it. Why not
<br>500px?
<br>
<br>* * *
<br>
<br>About the 500px Store you state: "We will never remove any legal or
<br>appropriate content from the 500px Store. "
<br>
<br>Can you elaborate on this? How is it handled exactly? This may have bee=
n
<br>in the terms something I overlooked. Because when I look at the terms
<br>specific to the store, you wrote:
<br>"In addition, 500px may remove any Store Images that it believes to be
<br>in breach of the Terms"
<br>
<br>I see a big difference between: "an image is inappropriate or illegal"
<br>and "we believe an image breaches our terms". When I read a content is
<br>illegal, to me that means either the infringement was really obvious, o=
r
<br>that a judge ruled that the content was illegal.=20
<br>
<br>* * *
<br>
<br>About the moral rights issue, I think the example is very far-fetched.
<br>How's it going to apply to a case for 500px? I am very sceptical.
<br>
<br>* * *
<br>
<br>As for the indemnification clause, it is not only about copyright (and
<br>500px would probably be under DMCA safe harbour or the EU ecommerce
<br>exemption of liability for copyright infringement) and in connection
<br>with the fact that you ask for a waiver of legal action, this all seem =
a
<br>bit broad to me. Again, if you compare to other services, they do not
<br>necessarily go to such an extent.
<br>
<br>
