Le mercredi 05 d=E9cembre 2012 =E0 06:38 -0800, Robin Monks a =E9crit :

I replied to somebody here by email. I wanted to comment on the blog
too, but I have to "Login or sign up to comment on this photo."

The arguments I had are not countered by this blog post. The moral right
example in the blog post has got *nothing to do* with what we're
discussing in the case of 500px.=20

It's almost laughable to read this:
        In a photographer=92s case, moral rights would apply. Hence, if a
        photographer sold a photo that was hung in a buyer=92s house that
        they didn=92t like =97 they could not sue the homeowner for that. I
        know that is on the edge of ridiculous but that is why that
        simple clause is there =97 it doesn=92t add value for the
        photographer and protects the buyer from.
       =20
Clearly: Moral rights would NOT apply to this. I think this is *insane*.
Anyway, these moral rights waiver are illegal in many countries.
