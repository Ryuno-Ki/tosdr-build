Yeah, sadly Canada (where I live and apparently where 500px is located) is
one of the places where Moral rights can be waived contractually. It just
seems completely stupid to me that their defense of these terms is
basically,  "sure our terms are way too broad and let us screw you, but,
you should trust us because we're photographers too". Um, no. I don't trust
them :P If they really want to be on the side of photographers they
shouldn't be down-playing their horrible ToS, they should be re-writing it.
