Hi Hugo,

you wrote:

This would be a bit easier if you would actually propose one. :) Now I have to guess what it is that you want...

I think your objection to the current phrasing is that there is no description of *how* the public group (i.e. this mailing list)
decides that it's time for a vote, meaning that anybody could organize silly votes, just to troll. That's a fair point, so to protect
against that let's say:

"A vote will be organized if at least at least three members agree that one is needed."

Just to be clear, any phrasings that refer to 'Unhosted e.V.' are not an option, because that e.V. has been made sort of dormant,
and also its members are unrelated to this project. This project is now independent, with its own community, so we have no choice
but to change it now. But what we change it *to*, you have 14 hours left to propose any improvements you want to make to the phrasing.


Ciao!
Michiel
