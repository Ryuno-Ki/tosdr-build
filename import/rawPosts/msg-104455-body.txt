I propose that we change
        Votes
            All polls shall be organised by Unhosted e.V.
        (http://www.unhosted.org) and announced on www.tos-dr.info; and
        announced at least 10 days in advance by email to the public
        group.
       =20
        to
       =20
        Votes
            All polls shall be organised by a member of the team
        (http://tos-dr.info/about.html#team) and announced at least 10
        days in advance on www.tos-dr.info and by email to the public
        group.
       =20
I would also like to change

        Definition of contributor
            A "contributor" is any person, excluding legal persons (e.g.
        corporations), who wrote at least one email to the group at
        least 30 days before the start of the poll.
       =20
and move that section after the "vote" to

        Definition of Contributor
            A Contributor is any person, excluding legal persons (e.g.
        corporations), who wrote at least one email to the group at
        least 90 days before the start of the poll.


If that proposal is accepted. You can count this email as my vote=20
