I think it makes sense for a Service to claim user feedback as property=20
because of the reasons you've provided here. I think if the Service=20
literally stole an idea from a user and implemented it, then the user might=
=20
feel upset. I can't imagine the likelihood of that happening being very=20
great, though.

I will note this as neutral. Thanks, Sebasti=E1n.
