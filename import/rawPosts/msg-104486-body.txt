I vote no, due to the lack of definition of "team". There seems to be no
community involvement in how the team is chosen or tasked. Perhaps I am
misunderstanding the process, but, if that's the case then I'd still vote
no until it can be explained in a proper detail.

Live in such a way that those who know you but don't know God, will come to
know God because they know you.
