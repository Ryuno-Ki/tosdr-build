Keeping Hugo's re-definition of contributor (repeated for sanity)

        Definition of contributor 
>             A "contributor" is any person, excluding legal persons (e.g. 
>         corporations), who wrote at least one email to the group at

>         least 90 days before the start of the poll.  


Finally an addition,

Definition of Team member
A Team member is any person, excluding legal persons:
a) who is listed on the team page of the project website 
(http://tos-dr.info/about.html#team) 
b) who has been granted write access to the project's source code 
repository (https://github.com/didnotread?tab=members)
c) in a special circumstance, where no team member posts a poll within 26 
days of its valid creation, a Team member can be created by a 70% voting in 
an announcement to the public email group. Such a Team member shall have 
the roll of Team member for a period of 180 days.


Thoughts?
