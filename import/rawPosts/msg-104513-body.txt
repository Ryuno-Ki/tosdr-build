I'm not sure about this one. To me, this is more like Allrecipes being 
explicit and saying "Hey, you can do this, but don't commit libel." I 
definitely think anything that infringes upon free speech is terrible, but 
I'm not sure I see free speech as the central issue here. This seems like 
it might be a fairly standard clause, actually. Do you know if any other 
services include similar clauses? What are your thoughts about this? Anyone 
else care to chime in, as well?
