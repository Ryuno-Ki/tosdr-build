This next paragraph is a bit strange to me.

I would just leave that out. We will sort out later when we have a good
structure how to handle changes. For now, we just make a small fix
because the Unhosted e.v. is going to stop its legal existence.

Anyway we have to delay this to a new vote, as the vote was supposed to
be today but there was no clear proposal.

Best regards,
Hugo
