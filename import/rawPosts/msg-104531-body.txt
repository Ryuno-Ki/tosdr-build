My thought is simply to plan out long-term scenarios to account for things
like: "what if the website goes down?", "what if GitHub becomes
inaccessible?", "How can the community survive if most current
team members leave, vanish, etc". I'm fine with leaving out (c) from the
Team member definition for the time being. Not everything has to plan for
every scenario at once.
