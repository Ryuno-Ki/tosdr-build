I personally feel this should be broken into two points. The first point=20
about the trial bills doesn't seem nearly as bad as "our prices change and=
=20
we won't tell you" point. I think the Trial point is a fairly standard=20
practice, and although that doesn't make it a good practice necessarily,=20
being standard means that more consumers potentially are aware of that (to=
=20
me). Thoughts?
