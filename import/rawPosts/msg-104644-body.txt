Actually, having read over this again, it doesn't say how to opt-out. Is 
anyone familiar with the process? Is it in fact similar to what Robin 
posted from CouchSurfing? There's nothing in the Terms of Indiegogo that 
explains you can opt-out via adjusting your profile or following 
instructions in their emails. Just want to be sure.
