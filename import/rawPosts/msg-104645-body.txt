Hi,=20

  So, you can delete your account (http://cdn.podhurl.com/image/1M0H411r1x2=
y), but theree's no indication that removes you from their promo emails. Th=
e emails seem to be sent with Mailchimp, and do have an "unsubscribe" link =
at the bottom (http://cdn.podhurl.com/image/3e023V3M2Q0U). They also appear=
 to be sent weekly (http://cdn.podhurl.com/image/153T0x0X0F1n). I started g=
etting them after sponsoring one of the Oatmeal campaigns, so, can attest t=
hat I didn't ask for the newsletter, just been too lazy to unsubscribe from=
 the stupid thing.
