I see these kinds of terms in a lot of ToS; it seems incredibly stupid and =
a large attempt and hindering free speech rights by=C2=A0companies. =C2=A0I=

<br>&gt; ok, i got a reply from them, what this is about is travel websites
<br>&gt; that have &#39;accomodation search&#39; linking to couchsurfing. t=
hey don&#39;t
<br>&gt; want that to happen. they will not use this clause against you if =
you
<br>&gt; just blog about them.
<br>
<br>We should not get fooled. This is not what the clause says. This
<br>interpretation is not binding and seems like just an excuse for terms o=
f
<br>bad quality.
<br>
<br>&gt; i guess this is about deeplinking to specific offers and/or iframi=
ng
<br>&gt; couchsurfing&#39;s content in a context, not about linking to the
<br>&gt; couchsurfing home page i think.
<br>
<br>The clause says linking, right? Is there a definition of linking
<br>anywhere? If not, then assume it&#39;s the standard definition of linki=
ng,
<br>i.e. to write somewhere on the web a &lt;a
<br>href=3D&quot;<a href=3D"http://couchsurfing.org" target=3D"_blank">http=
://couchsurfing.org</a>&quot;<u></u>&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.
<br>
<br>&gt; i think a couchsurfing offer is not a historical or newsworthy fac=
t,
<br>&gt; and i think this exposes the absurdity of web 2.0, where publishin=
g
<br>&gt; tools claim copyright over user content.
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; i guess they can prohibit other sites from quoting copyrighted
<br>&gt; information only if they are the owners/authors, right?
<br>
<br>No because quoting text is covered by the exceptions to copyright law
<br>(or fair use in the US).
<br>
<br>&gt; =C2=A0if they only
<br>&gt; get a non-exclusive license to user content, then how can they hav=
e
<br>&gt; anything to say over others displaying it?
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; can you prohibit other sites from deeplinking to specific search
<br>&gt; results on your site?
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; i think there was a similar case where google was displaying tweet=
s
<br>&gt; from twitter as &#39;real time results&#39; on their search result=
s page, and
<br>&gt; iirc, twitter was able to stop them from doing that.
<br>
<br>IIRC there was an agreement between google and twitter, then they didn&=
#39;t
<br>pursue it. But I think seriously this issue is getting too far. We&#39;=
re
<br>trying to make assumptions, whereas if you read the clause in question,
<br>it&#39;s rather simple and stupid. There was actually a website making =
fun
<br>of all these silly clauses forbidding people to make links.
<br>
<br>I propose, if we summarise this point, to write a title like:
<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Absurd: they claim the right to forbid you =
to link to them
<br>=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0=20
<br>or something like this.
