I changed my opinion about this. I propose to judge all terms that state 
your data can be sold without your consent as an asset in a merger as bad, 
unless they pay out the value of your data to you. Your data is yours, and 
should be yours to sell in case of a merger, not theirs. The fact that 
companies tend to sell your data and keep the money themselves is just the 
type of thing that makes the web2.0 business model abusive. Right now this 
case is marked as 'neutral' (10), but unless anyone objects, i'll update it 
to 'bad' (20).

The bright exception in the 'business-transfer' topic is github, who will 
notify you, and give you a change to close your account before the merger 
happens. this is now 'good' (5), but since i do think this is a nice 
gesture of them, concerning quite a relevant topic, unless anyone objects, 
i'll upgrade this to 'good' (20).

Cheers,
Michiel
