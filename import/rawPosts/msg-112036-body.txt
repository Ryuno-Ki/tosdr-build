I object to setting this as bad.

I understand that in theory, we would *like* to believe that we have an 
ownership interest in our data significant enough to merit compensation in 
the event of a company's merger or buyout. However, even in Europe (which 
respects user ownership of data), I'm not aware of any case law that 
suggests that users have a right to be compensated for the sale of their 
data. I'm not an attorney in the EU, but I've looked, and I'm not finding 
any case law supporting this idea. There is certainly no case law 
supporting it in the United States; to the contrary, in the US, the case 
law goes the other way.

Changing our opinion from neutral to bad does nothing but reflect what the 
policy should be like in an ideally user-centric world. ToS:DR users are 
not coming to us for our opinions on how things should be in an ideally 
user-centric world. In an ideally user-centric world, companies would have 
to pay us licensing fees for use of our copyrighted content. In an ideally 
user-centric world, there would be no limitation of liability clauses or 
disclaimers of warranty, because warranties are intended to protect 
consumers. In an ideally user-centric world, we wouldn't be licensing 
digital purchases, because they'd be sales and the digital copies would be 
owned. This is not an ideally user-centric world, and our position here is 
not to punish companies for failing to write their policies based on an 
ideally user-centric world. Our position here is to notify users about 
which companies have written their policies, in *this* world with our 
current laws, in ways that protect user rights and which companies have 
written their policies in ways that harm user rights. 

In short, changing our opinion on this moves us away from being a 
mostly-neutral guide to how terms of service affect the user to being, in 
my opinion, a deceptive force ourselves. If we are only using these ratings 
to push our own agenda, an agenda which has no grounding in the law of any 
country, then we mislead *our* users. We need to focus on providing users 
with a good resource that informs them about the terms of service that 
respect their rights under the laws we currently have, and the terms of 
service that do not respect their rights. We do not need to focus on 
denigrating *all* terms of service because none of them live up to an ideal 
world that does not currently exist.
