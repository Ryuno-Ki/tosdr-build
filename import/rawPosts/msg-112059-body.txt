hi Robin,

sorry this went unanswered so long, just catching up on some backlog :)

turns out we had "Microsoft" on there as the www.microsoft.com website,=20
whereas what we're interestd in is of course "Microsoft Services" ("your=20
Microsoft acccount").

When i go to outlook.com, i'm redirected to live.com, and there the terms=
=20
are=20
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/microsoft-services-agreemen=
t

I added this document to the service description and change the 'name'=20
field from 'Microsoft' to 'Microsoft Services'. This all needs some more=20
work though, when we're ready to assign a class to Microsoft Services, we=
=20
should make sure this is all cleaned up with all the right product names=20
and terms links.

Another thing, I just saw on the topics page that this point is marked as=
=20
"blocker (150)" whereas it doesn't seem to differ from the 500px, Netflix,=
=20
and Steam class action waivers. So i'm changing it to bad (50)" like the=20
other three.

Leaving only the 500px point about 'give up your moral right' as "blocker=
=20
(150)".
