2. MODERATION

CL has the right =85 to regulate content ( =85 postings =85 accounts) =85 p=
osted to =85 craigslist by any user =85 (including =85 *deletion* and/or *t=
ermination* of content, accounts =85). =85 CL action or inaction to regulat=
e content or conduct or to enforce against any potential violation of the T=
OU by any user =85 does not waive CL's right to implement or not implement =
regulation or enforcement measures with respect to any subsequent or simila=
r content, conduct or potential TOU violation.

You =85 agree that any action or inaction by =85 CL =85 to =85 regulate con=
tent =85 is undertaken voluntarily =85 and you expressly agree that neither=
 CL nor any CL Representative shall be liable to you =85 for any action or =
inaction to =85 regulate content, or to implement other enforcement measure=
s against any content =85 .

Although CL Representatives may moderate content =85, CL Representatives ha=
ve no authority to make binding commitments =85 to anyone that they or anyo=
ne else on behalf of CL will "take care" of any alleged problem or complain=
t =85. Accordingly, you =85 agree that any representation =85 by any CL Rep=
resentative =85 that CL =85 would or would not =85 regulate content (includ=
ing =85 *remove*, *terminate*, *delete* =85 any content), or to implement o=
ther enforcement measures against any content =85 is superseded by this pro=
vision and is nonbinding and unenforceable. Specifically, you agree that CL=
 =85 shall in no circumstance be liable as a result of any representation t=
hat CL =85 would or would not restrict or redress any content =85. This par=
agraph may not be modified, waived or released except by a written agreemen=
t, dated and signed by CL's Chief Executive Officer and dated and signed by=
 the individual or entity to whom the modification, waiver or release is gr=
anted.

CL =85 has the right =85 to =85 discontinue all or any portions of craigsli=
st at any time without notice. CL =85 shall not be liable for any such =85 =
discontinuance =85.
