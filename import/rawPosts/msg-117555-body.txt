hi, welcome!

thanks for joining :)

yes, you can just speak your mind. what is good about the terms of Yammer? 
what is bad about them? what things should people be especially aware of 
when choosing to agree to their terms of service or not?

you can create one mailing list thread per discussion point, and put [Good] 
or [Bad] at the beginning of the subject line, that makes it a bit easier 
to process, but either way, even if you put it all in one mailing list 
thread we'll work it out :) the important thing is to get some data points 
about the Yammer terms, on which we can base a review, and eventually come 
to an A-E rating.


Cheers,
Michiel
