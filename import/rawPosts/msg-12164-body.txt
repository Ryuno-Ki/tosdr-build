I'm not sure this is *good*, in and of itself. It's a little strange.

No one claims ownership of your content. That's standard. I only know of=20
one case *ever* where an online service has tried to actually claim=20
ownership of users' copyrights. None of the major online services claim=20
ownership of users' content, not even the ones with really, really=20
god-awful Terms of Service. The way it always works is that users retain=20
ownership of their copyrights, but by agreeing to the Terms of Service,=20
they give the content provider a license to use that content...and that=20
license may be more or less broad. A very broad license can be a very bad=
=20
thing for content owners, because it deprives them of control over their=20
stuff.

So...actually looking at the Weebly ToS, I have no idea how broad a license=
=20
they're claiming. They're actually not using any of the operative words=20
that would *create a license* here. I don't know what Weebly is claiming=20
the right to do with my content if I host it on their service (e.g.,=20
reproduce, modify, distribute, perform, display?). I don't know if the=20
right I give them is exclusive or non-exclusive. I don't know if it's bound=
=20
by territory. I don't know if Weebly is planning on paying me for the right=
=20
to use my content. I only know that the license isn't perpetual.

That's not very useful, and that's some astonishingly poor contract=20
drafting right there.=20

So I wouldn't call that *good* -- I'd call that bad, both for Weebly (who's=
=20
apparently begging to get sued) and for Weebly's users, who have no way of=
=20
knowing what Weebly's doing with their content.

Side note: check out Section 14. If you create any themes for Weebly, you=
=20
give Weebly *exclusive* rights to them. Which means once you contribute=20
that content to the service, no one but Weebly gets to use them without=20
Weebly's permission, *not even you, *including any code used for the theme =
*and=20
any media used, such as images. *Yikes*. *Not loving that.
