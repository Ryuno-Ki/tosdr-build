Hi Michiel (fellow Dutchie I suppose ;)?)!=20

Personally, I don't see how it makes a difference in security to require us=
ers to send a fax instead of mail, because users have to hand over a copy o=
f their ID and the email-adress (which is linked to the Twitter-account) ei=
ther way. Why is a fax in this situation 'safer' than mail I wonder? In my =
opinion faxes a not required: Facebook also allows mails for data requests.=
 In fact, I believe that the exercise of a right to access should be exerci=
sed the same way as the way an agreement is created. For example: if you cr=
eate an account on a website, you should also be allowed to request your in=
formation using that website (or by mail, as long as it's possible via inte=
rnet).

Also I'm not sure about the points. Yes, Twitter allows a right to access f=
or their users, but all companies (controllers) who process data of Europea=
ns have to! So why give them so much credit for that?=20
