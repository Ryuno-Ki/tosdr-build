I think a good way to think about it is that practice is influenced in
one third by law, in one third by the terms of service, and in one
third by employee decisions.

So I would estimate, if employee behavior is exactly random (50/50),
then the terms mentioning your right to request your private data,
would increase the chance of this being true in practice, from 50% to 83%.

The only situation where I think we should take more context into
account is where the terms of service A state a good or a bad thing,
about which service B simply doesn't say anything, because it's
implied by common sense or by law.

In this case, I think the rating of +30 for mentioning that you can
obtain your private data, and +40 if it can be done without a lot of
work such as sending faxes or letters, is fair. This is recorded in

https://github.com/tosdr/tosdr.org/blob/5c2a4690f43d47eaed02b2fac18bbaf4a246a2d6/scripts/cases.js#L35-L38

Please reply to this thread and propose a different rating if you
think otherwise.


Cheers!
Michiel
