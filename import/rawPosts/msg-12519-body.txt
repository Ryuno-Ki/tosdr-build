I believe both of these are missing from your excellent service.


=3D=3D Mega.co.nz - Mega - Encrypted cloud storage =3D=3D


I especially like the presentation of Mega=92s ToS as it is presented in a =
readable format with good sectioning to separate what terms apply to which =
parts of the service. Every section is kept small and understandable. The t=
erms though are presented in English and not the users language. The servic=
e itself is presented in multiple languages, this appears to be crowd trans=
lated which would explain the terms not being subject to translation.


Terms can be changed at any time but users will be informed about this (Sec=
tion 3)


You are free to delete your account (Section 21)


Extracting data (Not specifically noted in any section)
Though the service currently is Cloud storage and some user to user messagi=
ng they plan to expand into VoIP and email soon. Files can easily be extrac=
ted but there is so far as I can tell no means of extracting things like co=
ntact lists and messages. I will contact Mega regarding such extraction for=
 clarification.


Data stored on the service is encrypted using keys held by the user so Mega=
 has no access to them. Though there is no anonymity it is a private servic=
e. They will also by their own public admission (twitter - no citation link=
s presently) not make any effort to prevent users from since TOR or other a=
nonymity technologies when accessing the service.=A0


They have a well documented process in place to handle DMCA and other copyr=
ight violations. Since Mega has no knowledge of the files stored, this is o=
nly applicable in cases where a user has publicly shared a file. They also =
make the user aware that doing so negates the privacy of that file for anyo=
ne in possession of the link. They also have a process for filing a counter=
 claim to any such request (Section 19 and 20).
One presumes that being in possession of any such shared file(s) which has =
been the subject of a valid DMCA or other copyright takedown would be reaso=
nable grounds to compel a user to provide decryption keys under the law in =
many countries which is probably reasonable and at any rate not something M=
ega can put conditions for in their ToS. They could though put such notices=
 in their service like they do to explain the loss of privacy when sharing =
a link.



They remind you that the password should be strong and held securely as if =
it is lost there is no means of recovery and it is the provider of security=
 for your data (Section 18)


I believe these are A class terms, with bonus points for an excellent easy =
to read presentation.



Terms of Service - https://mega.co.nz/#terms

Privacy policy -=A0https://mega.co.nz/#privacy


=A0=3D=3D rdio.com - rdio - streaming music service =3D=3D


This is a traditional legalese Terms of Service agreement with long section=
s and unclear separation. They do however get points for presenting it in t=
he users language.


Terms can be changed at any time and you will not be informed of such chang=
es. It is the users responsibility to constantly stay aware of the terms of=
 service and continued use as changes are published is considered accepting=
 changes (Section 19)


You grant rdio and its associated companies rights to any content you uploa=
d. They may also use and publish your name in conjunction with any such con=
tent (Section 10)


Users can have access terminated at any time if Rdio judges that the ToS ha=
ve been violated, have gotten a request regarding such a violation (one ass=
umes copyright or DMCA request) or your use of the service is deemed =93uns=
uitable=94 or =93unacceptable=94 =A0(neither term defined so basically this=
 must mean.. if they feel like it). (Section 16)


If you are in a region where rdio sells downloadable music, this content is=
 DRM free and in the common mp3 format. Such files are, potentially, waterm=
arked and such information is stored in the file. If the service is termina=
ted this content will remain usable (Section 3.2)


There are no provisions of having an account terminated and deleted permane=
ntly from the service, nor for extracting data so far as I can tell.


There isn=92t much nice stuff to say about rdio=92s terms, they are likely =
in Class D or E.

Kind regards,

Thank you for the service, it really does I hope make terms of service a li=
ttle easier to figure out for regular users.
