We have a similar point for tumblr. I made them both "good, 10" since I 
think it's what we would normally expect. If you look at other points in 
the ownership topic, you see that this is a topic where services can mostly 
lose points if they claim ownership of something that's yours, not win many 
points by statements like this which are almost tautologies. The only way 
to win many points on ownership is by offering a data export functionality.
