I agree with Hugo that it is obvious that they have to host your data in=20
order to provide any service at all.

About the 'and others', Facebook is used to share content with others, so=
=20
it's obvious that they need to keep what you shared to provide the service=
=20
to the recipients of what you shared.

I'll close this point as irrelevant, so that it will not show up in our=20
review on tosdr.org. If someone still wants this point to show up on the=20
site, then please reply to this discussion thread, or start a new one.
