The data point from that other discussion (O1jol2PECRM) was dismissed 
though, so publishing this one as data point (3e_7ai3Aljc), with the -50 
score that was already assigned to it. In any case, we should do a check 
through the law-gov topic to see whether we are penalizing and rewarding 
all sites equally on this topic, instead of only rating this for services 
where someone raised a point about it.
