Unfortunately, they also say this:
"Please note that in some cases, Steam will be unable to give refunds for s=
ome third party DLC"
Example: those who purchased a specific GTA V bundle with DLC were unable t=
o return the product for a refund later, as it was bundled with "some third=
 party DLC" unbeknownst to the customer.

In other words, the developer can bar customers from receiving refunds by b=
undling all copies of their titles with a DLC product that meets the necess=
ary requirements, and they don't even have to inform the buyer.

Refunds also do not apply to movies.

Valve has a ways to go on this, but they're headed in the right direction.
