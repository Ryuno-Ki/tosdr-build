"Finally, we will access, disclose and preserve personal data, including yo=
ur content
(such as the content of your emails, other private communications or files =
in private
folders), when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to: .=
.."

Note that when you agree to any new Microsoft EULA you are agreeing to the =
Privacy
Statement. The above statement does not just apply to Windows 10 but to Sky=
pe and
almost any Microsoft product, so if you install Skype on Windows XP you are=
 agreeing
to this Privacy statement.

"This privacy statement explains what personal data we collect from you and=
 how we
use it. It applies to Bing, Cortana, MSN, Office, OneDrive, Outlook.com, Sk=
ype,
Windows, Xbox and other Microsoft services that display this statement."

This statement does not distinguish between private folders on a network se=
rvice or
private folders on your local computer or possibly on a shared company serv=
er mapped
to a local drive on your PC.

If your company holds ANY third party confidential information (e.g. Accoun=
tant,
Lawyer, Doctor, Arhcitect, Service Provider) about a third party and you ha=
ve a
confidentiallity agreement (physical or implied) with your customers and ..=
.

If you are using ANY Microsoft Product and have agreed to the new Privacy S=
tatement
by installing Microsoft software on an old computer or purchasing a new com=
puter, you
have violated your confidentiallity agreement with your customers as you ha=
ve agreed
that in certain circumstances that do not require a court order, this
confidential third party information could possibly be taken by Microsoft a=
nd/or
given to someone else.=20

While this may never happen and techincally it may not be possible in Windo=
ws
XP/Vista/7 etc (without an update), you still have violated your confidenti=
allity
agreement with your customer by agreeing to the POSSIBILITY of the informat=
ion being
transmitted to Microsoft.

One quote that was in the Preview Privacy Policy that did not make it into =
the
Privacy Statement above is:

"To stop the transmission of all data, you must completely uninstall the Pr=
ogram
software and services from all of your devices. This may require you to rei=
nstall
your device=E2=80=99s operating system."

While this is not in the statement it seems to be fact at the moment.
