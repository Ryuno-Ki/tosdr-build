Hello everyone,<br>
<br>
As contributors to the ToS;DR project, I&#39;d like to ask all of you<br>
feedback and opinions about the User Data Manifesto (version 2):<br>
<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0<a href=3D"https://userdatamanifesto.org/=
2.0/" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://userdatamanifesto.org/2.=

<br>
We (some of us in the team <a href=3D"https://tosdr.org/about.html" rel=3D"=
noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://tosdr.org/about.html</a>) are thinkin=
g<br>
about supporting the manifesto officially in the name of the ToS;DR<br>
project community.<br>
<br>
This manifesto aims at bringing together people and groups working to<br>
achieve better protection of users&#39; rights online, by defining core<br>
freedoms and rights that users should have on their data online. The<br>
manifesto was written collaboratively by many people including two<br>
ToS;DR founders (Jan-Christoph and myself).<br>
<br>
For some context: the only other official parternships to date are with<br>
EFF and ISOC, with whom we work on &lt;<a href=3D"https://tosback.org/" rel=
=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">https://tosback.org/</a>&gt;, and with<br=
>
<a href=3D"http://5apps.com" rel=3D"noreferrer" target=3D"_blank">5apps.com=
</a> who provides us with web hosting.<br>
<br>
I&#39;m looking forward to your feedback, please provide it before August 2=
7.<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
