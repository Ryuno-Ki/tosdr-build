Yes, it depends on the context. We're not saying that not allowing
pseudonyms in all circumstances is a bad thing.=20

> From a quick glance at Facebook, it's pretty clear that pseudonyms
> are almost exclusively used by fake profiles and spampots.

I do not use Facebook, but I have read elsewhere that this is
absolutely not the case. In any event, the behaviour of spambot isn't
a good standard to judge whether the rule is good or not, spambots are
just designed to abuse rules anyway.

> I understand how pseudonyms can protect some people, who would like free =
speech, but cannot for whatever reason.

And this is an important issue for Facebook, considering that it's
probably the most general and large platform allowing people to
publish on the web today.

> But disallowing pseudonyms also allow you to know that what they say is s=
omething they're not afraid to take responsibility for. When you talk with =
someone on Facebook, you can be far more sure, that you're talking to a per=
son who is who he says he is, and thus, you avoid some parts of "trolling",=
 i.e. pretending to be someone you're not, in the effort to trick people.

I do not think that disallowing pseudoyms is really working in
Facebook to protect against trolling. Does it?

In any case, for the reason stated above, I don't think that this
alone is enough to dismiss the fact that disallowing pseudonyms harm
the freedom to speak of some people and that it's too important to
ignore.


> That can still happen on Facebook, of course, but I think it's enough to =
not make it a conclusively negative thing.

I suppose we disagree. I'm interested in knowing what others would
think here, but I want to also make clear that ToS;DR is also biased
in favour of users=E2=80=99 rights online, and raising awareness regarding
what's in the terms. Now, considering the amount of legitimate users
who want to use pseudonyms in Facebook and considering the amount of
these users who actually *do* use pseudonyms: I think they're entitled
to know that unfortunately Facebook does not allow pseudos in their
terms (when we checked--has this changed? The ToS have changed so the
analysis is out of date at the moment).=20

> And it's clearly possible to find places to by anynomous elsewhere, and s=
till reach a big audience. After all, the vast majority of sites allow pseu=
donyms, including social media sites.

I don't think there's anything quite as large as Facebook for this.
