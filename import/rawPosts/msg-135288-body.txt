Well, that's how it used to be. Now that you mention it, you are right that=
 it's not the case any longer. Facebook is also allowing nicknames now (Set=
tings->Edit Name->Add Another Name->Nickname), so I guess they're moving sl=
ightly away from it.

Facebook would not be likely to have existed if not for the real names. Rem=
ember that it only got so popular, because it was something exclusive, and =
something personal. And I'm not sure it's a strong enough platform that the=
y'll keep being popular if they allowed pseudonyms. Because something usual=
ly happens when a majority starts using pseudonyms: it becomes scary to hav=
e you real name, since most people choose not to. So how could you trust pe=
ople with your real name if they don't?

 something they're not afraid to take responsibility for. When you talk wit=
h someone on Facebook, you can be far more sure, that you're talking to a p=

", i.e. pretending to be someone you're not, in the effort to trick people.

I think it does protect against trolling. But it doesn't protect fully of c=
ourse. But trolling also usually occurs from people who have a profile pict=
ure of something that isn't themselves (an object, or a place for example),=
 which means that you can know that people who are not ready to be open abo=
ut themselves, don't have a picture of themselves. I think it does make a d=
ifference.

I don't disagree with that. I think it's good to inform users about this. T=
he reason I have the ToS;DR plugin as well, is because I'm not great at goi=
ng through the ToS.

I think Facebook is the biggest place, yes. But what is "for this"? I think=
 it really depends on what your purpose is. If you're a company, there's no=
 point in pseudonyms of course (unless you're trying to phish). And if you'=
re a (human) person, I can't think of many (if any) scenarios where you can=
 do something on Facebook, that you can't do elsewhere. At least, I can't t=
hink of any features where Facebook would be useful for someone who wanted =
to be anonymous. Because there's forums for all kinds of things. Reddit bei=
ng one of the big platforms (suicide hotlines, anonymous addicts, sensitive=
 sexuality subjects, religion change from fundamentalist families - and man=
y more). And for news, there's twitter. And for social interaction in very =
specific subjects, there's all the many forums that exist.

Maybe for the games? Or events?
Although I think the games are hardly good enough to attract a lot of peopl=
e for that to be relevant - and I have difficulty imagining many cases wher=
e it's relevant (from a protect-user-rights perspective) to by anonymous wh=
en discussing an event. Perhaps demonstrations? That's all I can think of. =
Because if it's more private than that, then there's no useful idea in usin=
g Facebook.

So I guess, I just don't understand why someone would want to be anonymous =
on a platform, that is mostly useful, because you're not anonymous.
