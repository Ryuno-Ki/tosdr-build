I do not think that allowing pseudonyms would have really lower the
success of Facebook in terms of size. Why do I think that? Because in
spite of the policy to exclude pseudonyms, a lot of users on Facebook
do not use their real name anyway.

> > I don't think there's anything quite as large as Facebook for this.
>=20
> I think Facebook is the biggest place, yes. But what is "for this"?

With Facebook, anyone can easily publish posts without having to
configure a server or a blog. It's very easy and it has a massive
size. By =E2=80=9Cthis=E2=80=9D I meant =E2=80=9Cpublishing on the Web for =
individuals=E2=80=9D, which
is what I believe Facebook is mainly (in terms of what it's used for
by the majority of users).=20

> So I guess, I just don't understand why someone would want to be anonymou=
s on a platform, that is mostly useful, because you're not anonymous.

An important distinction to make: this is not about anonymity. Someone
with a pseudonym is not anonymous. Anonymous means "no name" at all
whereas, with a pseudonym, you have a name; it's just not the same name
that the State has registered for you.

There are a lot of people who are actually known under a pseudonym
more than under their =E2=80=9Ccivil name=E2=80=9D.


But maybe this rule is not up to date, can you check the terms today
regarding what users are allowed to do with pseudonyms?

Thank you,
