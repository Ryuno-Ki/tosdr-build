I think there's a big difference between the purpose. The vast majority of =
the people I know that don't use their real name, just use a nickname, but =
their friends still know who they really are.
If pseudonyms were the norm, then I'd find it likely that you'd lose the kn=
owledge of whether each profile represented one person (or e.g. if people u=
sed multiple identities) and whether that person is actually someone you re=
ally know or not. There's a big difference between social interaction on th=
e Internet, with strangers, or with people you also know in real life. (Pre=
sumably due to missing body language, vocal tone etc.)

And since Facebook was made famous because it was exclusively for students =
who could confirm their identity, it has always been about the personal ide=
ntity. Somewhat like LinkedIn, but for spare time. Now there's a lot of oth=
er things there, since the commercial industry really took part in it, but =
I for one can by no means presume that Facebook would stand strong, if pseu=
donyms were explicitly allowed. At least not in the long run.

But twitter and reddit are also very large platforms that can do this, righ=
t? They both allow pseudonyms.

Sure, but the distinction is mostly important for those with the power to i=
nvestigate the background of a certain online identity.
To must people, it's just an alias - like wearing a mask at a masquerade.
You can still be personal with a mask on, but never quite as personal (show=
ing strong responsibility for your actions). And you can also be very imper=
sonal and rude, and easily get away with it, because you're just another ra=
ndom identity.

I know. Especially Internet celebrities. Captain Sparkles is one example. B=
ut to my understanding, it's not against the terms to have a profile that r=
epresents an online identity - especially not if it's famous. At least, I'v=
e seen many examples of this - and Captain Sparklez is one of those.

I don't understand why it's explicitly important to have a separate identit=
y all across the Internet though?
I know many of my (older) family members wouldn't use Facebook if it wasn't=
 personal.

It's not that I agree with everything the Facebook culture does by the way =
- I just wondered why this pseudonym part was shown as definitely negative.

Sorry, I'm not great at that. It's not that important to me either. I'm sur=
e it is to someone, who'll then look at it.

Thanks for the discussion.
