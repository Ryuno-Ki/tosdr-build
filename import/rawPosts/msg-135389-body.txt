this Imperialist privilege not a right rhetoric from insanely profitable
user generated content host makes me sick.

http://www.kongregate.com/pages/terms

"Your use of this Kongregate web site ("Site"), and your use of any account
you create at the Site ("Account") is subject to these Terms of Use
(=E2=80=9CTerms=E2=80=9D),"

No check box, your here so you agree.




"which we may update from time to time"

and boy do they




. "Your use of this Site or your Account after we post any changes to these
Terms constitutes your agreement to those changes."

not going to warn you.



"Kongregate may, in its sole discretion, elect to warn you if you have been
found in violation of these Terms,"

that they change without warning


"however it retains the right and may at any time, discontinue or modify
this Site or any part thereof or may discontinue or modify your use of this
Site or your Account, with or without notice to you at any time."

totalitarian control over you without your consent, by reading this
sentence you agree to suck my dick, wonder if that would hold up in a US
court as consent.


"You agree that you do not have any rights in this Site and that Kongregate
will have no liability to you if this Site is modified, discontinued or
your ability to access it is terminated."

no appeals, no habeas corpus,


"If you do not agree with these Terms, you should immediately discontinue
all use of this Site and your Account."


your telling me...


hope that helps you get started, ill dig up the "creators" contracts and
see what rights they claim to submissions, id be surprised if its even a
royalty system anymore...
