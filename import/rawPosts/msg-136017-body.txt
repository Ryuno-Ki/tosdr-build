country where all Licensed User(s) are principally located. Additional fees=
 may apply to a transfer of the License, or the principal location of      =
any Licensed User, to another country, or to contract for global use. MathW=
orks may restrict a transfer of a License to another country or restrict it=
s use in another country if MathWorks reasonably believes that such transfe=
r or use will result in a breach of this Agreement.

7. RETENTION OF RIGHT, TITLE AND INTEREST BY MATHWORKS AND ITS LICENSORS. T=
he Programs shall at all times remain the property of MathWorks and/or Math=
Works' Licensors and Licensee shall have no right, title, or interest there=
in, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Licensee shall take ap=
propriate action by instruction, agreement, or otherwise with any persons p=
ermitted access to the Programs, so as to enable Licensee to satisfy its ob=
ligations under the terms of this Agreement, including disabling access to =
the Programs, in the event of a transfer of the License.

8. LICENSES FOR THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND DATA. MathWorks has bee=
n granted licenses to distribute certain Third Party Software as part of or=
 included with the Programs licensed. These licenses require MathWorks to d=
istribute the software to Licensee subject to specific terms and conditions=
, which may provide rights and impose restrictions for use of the Programs,=
 including deployment of Applications, that are different from or additiona=
l to those contained herein. Should such Third Party Software be provided u=
nder the Lesser General Public License, Licensee may make modifications of =
the work identified in Section 6 of the Lesser General Public License for L=
icensee's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.=
 Licensee agrees that acceptance of this Agreement also confirms Licensee's=
 acceptance of any applicable Third Party Software licenses. Such Third Par=
ty licenses may be viewed at mathworks.com/thirdpartylicenseagreementsR2015=
b. Certain MathWorks Programs may also provide an interface to facilitate L=
icensee's use of Third Party services and data governed by the terms and co=
nditions set forth in such Third Party's applicable agreements with License=
e. This Agreement does not grant any additional rights to access or use suc=
h Third Party services or data made accessible through the use of MathWorks=
 Programs.

9. SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE SERVICE. During any paid Software Maintenance Servi=
ce term, if applicable, MathWorks shall provide its customary Software Main=
tenance Service for the licensed Programs which consists of: delivering sub=
sequent releases of the Programs, if any, that are not charged for separate=
ly; exerting reasonable efforts to both (a) provide, within a reasonable ti=
me, workarounds for any material programming errors in the current release =
of the Programs that are directly attributable to MathWorks, and (b) correc=
t such errors in the next available release, provided Licensee provides Mat=
hWorks with sufficient information to identify the errors. During this same=
 paid Software Maintenance Service term, Licensee shall also be entitled to=
      receive technical support for the current release. Technical support =
means assistance by telephone, web, and e-mail with the installation and/or=
 use of the then-current release of the licensed Programs, including all av=
ailable bug fixes and patches, and their interaction with supported hardwar=
e and operating systems ("Platforms"). Software Maintenance Service may pro=
vide access to certain online features and services made available by MathW=
orks from time to time. Licensee understands and agrees that access to such=
 online capabilities shall expire unless Licensee renews its Software Maint=
enance Service. MathWorks reserves the option to discontinue, in whole or i=
n part, and at any time, offering Software Maintenance Service and/or techn=
ical support for any Program, feature of a Program, or Platform or to refus=
e to provide Software Maintenance Service to a Licensee whom it reasonably =
believes is in breach of this Agreement.

10. LICENSE DURATION ("TERM"). This Agreement shall continue until the earl=
ier of (a) termination by MathWorks or Licensee as provided below, or (b) s=
uch time as there are no Programs being licensed to Licensee hereunder.

10.1. For Annual Licenses: Licensee understands and agrees that each Annual=
 License and associated Software Maintenance Service will expire automatica=
lly and the Programs will stop operating promptly after its corresponding o=
ne (1) year period, unless Licensee renews its License by remitting the the=
n-current annual License fee and provided the Licensee always remains in co=
mpliance with the terms of this Agreement.

10.2. For Term Licenses: Licensee understands and agrees that each Term Lic=
ense and associated Software Maintenance Service will expire automatically =
and the Programs will stop operating promptly after the corresponding perio=
d of the term licensed, unless Licensee renews its License by remitting the=
 then-current term License fee and provided the Licensee always remains in =
compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

10.3. For Perpetual Licenses: Licensee shall have the right to use the Prog=
rams indefinitely, subject to the termination provisions in this Agreement.=
 Licensee understands and agrees that the Software Maintenance Service for =
each Perpetual License will terminate automatically upon expiration of the =
initial Software Maintenance Service term included with the acquisition of =
the License. Thereafter, the Software Maintenance Service term may be renew=
ed for any Program, at the then-current price, and for the then-applicable =
term, as long as MathWorks offers such Software Maintenance Service for suc=
h Program and provided the Licensee always remains in compliance with the t=
erms of this Agreement.

red to terminate the availability of such use.

11. TERMINATION. MathWorks may terminate this Agreement and all Licenses gr=
anted hereunder by written notice to Licensee if Licensee breaches any mate=
rial term of this Agreement, including failure to pay any License fees due,=
 and Licensee has not cured such breach within sixty (60) days of written n=
otification. MathWorks may immediately terminate this Agreement and all Lic=
enses granted hereunder if, after requesting and failing to receive from th=
e Licensee adequate assurances of compliance with the terms of this Agreeme=
nt, MathWorks reasonably believes that Licensee is or is intending to breac=
h any material term of this Agreement. MathWorks may immediately terminate =
upon notice this Agreement and all Licenses granted hereunder should Licens=
ee breach the terms and conditions of Articles 4, 5, 7, and/or 12. If Licen=
see or any of its Affiliates commences or participates in any legal proceed=
ing against MathWorks or any of MathWorks' Affiliates challenging or assert=
ing any intellectual property rights in or against any of the Programs lice=
nsed hereunder, then MathWorks may, without waiving any other legal rights =
or remedies available to it, immediately terminate this License. The forego=
ing sentence only applies to (a) a Licensee who has as its principal busine=
ss the holding of patents and who does not engage, either directly or throu=
gh an Affiliate, in any material active business of making products that em=
body the patents or (b) a Licensee who engages, either directly or through =
an Affiliate, in a principal business of licensing or making available comm=
ercial off the shelf ("COTS") software to Third Parties. Licensee may termi=
nate this License at any time, for any reason. Licensee shall not be entitl=
ed to any refund if this License is terminated, except for License fees pai=
d for any Programs for which the Acceptance Period has not expired at the t=
ime of termination. Upon termination for any reason, Licensee shall promptl=
y return all but archival copies of the Programs in Licensee's possession o=
r control, or promptly provide written certification of their destruction.

12. EXPORT CONTROL. The Programs may be subject to U.S. export control laws=
 or other (U.S. and non-U.S.) governmental export and import laws and regul=
ations. Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement or Third Party agr=
eement, Licensee's rights under this Agreement may not be exercised by Lice=
nsee or any Third Party in violation of such laws and regulations, nor may =
this Agreement be transferred to any party where doing so would result in s=
uch a violation. The terms of any limitation on the use, transfer or re-exp=
ort of the Programs imposed by MathWorks in any Destination Control Stateme=
nt or other document for the purpose of export control shall prevail over a=
ny term in this Agreement. It shall be Licensee's responsibility to comply =
with the latest United States or other governmental export and import regul=
ations.

13. FEDERAL ACQUISITION. This provision applies to all acquisitions of the =
Programs and Documentation by, for, or through the federal government of th=
e United States. By accepting delivery of the Programs or Documentation, th=
e government hereby agrees that this software or documentation qualifies as=
 commercial computer software or commercial computer software documentation=
 as such terms are used or defined in FAR 12.212, DFARS Part 227.72, and DF=
ARS 252.227-7014. Accordingly, the terms and conditions of this Agreement a=
nd only those rights specified in this Agreement, shall pertain to and gove=
rn the use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, and =
disclosure of the Programs and Documentation by the federal government (or =
other entity acquiring for or through the federal government) and shall sup=
ersede any conflicting contractual terms or conditions. If this License fai=
ls to meet the government's needs or is inconsistent in any respect with fe=
deral procurement law, the government agrees to return the Programs and Doc=
umentation, unused, to MathWorks.

14. EUROPEAN UNION SOFTWARE DIRECTIVE. For any Licensed User properly licen=
sed to use the Programs within the European Union, any contractual provisio=
ns of this Agreement contrary to laws implemented pursuant to Article 6 of =
Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 Ap=
ril 2009 on the legal protection of computer programs or to the exceptions =
provided for in Article 5(2) and (3) of such Directive shall be null and vo=
id solely to the extent decompiling, disassembling, or otherwise reverse-en=
gineering of the Programs is necessary to enable the Licensee to achieve th=
e interoperability of an independently created program with the Programs or=
 any other permitted objectives specified by such laws implemented under su=
ch Directive (collectively, the "Permitted Objectives"), consistent with th=
e Directive, provided that any such information gained is used solely for s=
uch Permitted Objectives and solely in the European Union.

15. TAXES, DUTIES, CUSTOMS. Absent appropriate exemption certificates or ot=
her conclusive proof of tax exempt status, Licensee shall pay all applicabl=
e sales, use, excise, value-added, and other taxes, duties, levies, assessm=
ents, and governmental charges payable in connection with this Agreement or=
 the Licenses granted hereunder, excluding taxes based on or measured by Ma=
thWorks' income, for which MathWorks shall be solely responsible.

16. ASSIGNMENT. Licensee may not assign or otherwise transfer this Agreemen=
t and any License hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, without the =
written consent of MathWorks. Licensee agrees that MathWorks may withhold s=
uch consent if it determines, in its sole discretion, that a principal purp=
ose of the acquisition of this License was to assign the License to a Third=
 Party. In the case of any permitted or other lawful assignment or transfer=
, the terms of this Agreement including any License hereunder shall be bind=
ing upon, and inure to the benefit of, the transferee or assignee.

17. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. The Programs should not be relied on as the so=
le basis to solve a problem or implement a design whose incorrect solution =
or implementation could result in injury to person or property. If a Progra=
m is employed in such a manner, it is at the Licensee's own risk and MathWo=
rks and its Licensors explicitly disclaim all liability for such misuse to =
the extent allowed by law. MathWorks' and MathWorks' Licensors' liability f=
or death or personal injury resulting from negligence or for any other matt=
er in relation to which liability by law cannot be excluded or limited shal=
l not be excluded or limited. Except as aforesaid, (a) any other liability =
of MathWorks and its Licensors (whether in relation to breach of contract, =
negligence or otherwise) shall not in total exceed the amount paid to MathW=
orks under this Agreement in the twelve month period preceding the claim in=
 question, for the Program with respect to which the liability in question =
arises; and (b) MathWorks and its Licensors shall have no liability for any=
 indirect or consequential loss (whether foreseeable or otherwise and inclu=
ding loss of profits, loss of business, loss of opportunity, and loss of us=
e of any computer hardware or software). Some states do not allow the exclu=
sion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above exc=
lusion or limitation may not apply to Licensee.

18. LIMITED WARRANTY/LIMITATION OF REMEDIES. MathWorks warrants that MathWo=
rks, on its own behalf or through its Licensors, has the right to grant the=
 License rights hereunder. MathWorks warrants that the physical media provi=
ded shall be free from defects in material and workmanship for a period of =
ninety (90) days from delivery, or it will be replaced by MathWorks at no c=
ost to Licensee. MathWorks further warrants, for a period of one (1) year f=
rom delivery or for the term of the License, whichever is less, that each c=
opy of each Program will conform in all material respects to the descriptio=
n of such Program's operation in the Documentation. In the event that a Pro=
gram does not operate as warranted, Licensee's exclusive remedy and MathWor=
ks' sole liability under this warranty shall be the correction or workaroun=
d by MathWorks of major defects within a reasonable time. Should such corre=
ction or workaround be impractical, MathWorks may, at its option, terminate=
 the relevant License and refund the initial License fee paid to MathWorks =
for such Program. All requests for warranty assistance should be directed t=
o The MathWorks, Inc., 3 Apple Hill Drive, Natick, MA 01760-2098, U.S.A.

19. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. Except for warranties expressly set forth in =
Article 18 of this Agreement (or as implied by law where the law provides t=
hat the particular terms implied cannot be excluded by contract), any and a=
ll Programs, Documentation, and Software Maintenance Services are delivered=
 "as is" and MathWorks makes and the Licensee receives no additional expres=
s or implied warranties. MathWorks and its Licensors hereby expressly discl=
aim any and all other conditions, warranties, or other terms of any kind or=
 nature concerning the Programs, Documentation, and Software Maintenance Se=
rvices (including, without limitation, any with regard to infringement, mer=
chantability, quality, accuracy, or fitness for a particular purpose or Lic=
ensee's purpose). MathWorks also expressly disclaims any warranties that ma=
y be implied from usage of trade, course of dealing, or course of performan=
ce. Except for the express warranties stated in Article 18 of this Agreemen=
t, the Programs, Documentation, and Software Maintenance Services are provi=
ded with all faults, and the entire risk of satisfactory quality, performan=
ce, accuracy, and effort is with Licensee. MathWorks does not warrant that =
the Programs and Documentation will operate without interruption or be erro=
r free. Some states and countries do not allow limitations on how long an i=
mplied warranty lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to Licensee. T=
he warranty in Article 18 gives Licensee specific legal rights and Licensee=
 may also have other rights which vary from state to state and country to c=
ountry. Licensee accepts responsibility for its use of the Programs and the=
 results obtained therefrom.

20. GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION. This Agreement shall be interpreted, enfor=
ced and construed and the rights of the parties hereunder governed in all r=
espects by the laws of the State of Delaware United States of America, with=
out regard to its conflicts of law provisions, and both parties consent to =
the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in said State and =
consent to the service of process, pleadings and notices in connection with=
 any and all actions initiated in such courts. The parties agree that a fin=
al judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and bindin=
g and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction. To the extent any governin=
g law, treaty, or regulation is in conflict with this Agreement, the confli=
cting terms of this Agreement shall be superseded only to the extent requir=
ed by such law, treaty, or regulation. If any provision of this Agreement s=
hall be otherwise unlawful, void, or otherwise unenforceable, that provisio=
n shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible. In either case, the =
remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected. The parties agree that t=
he U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall n=
ot apply to this Agreement. The parties further agree that the Uniform Comp=
uter Information Transactions Act, or any version thereof, adopted by any s=
tate, in any form ("UCITA"), shall not apply to this Agreement. To the exte=
nt that UCITA is applicable, the parties agree to opt out of the applicabil=
ity of UCITA pursuant to the Opt-Out provision(s) contained therein.

, MathWorks or its authorized representative shall, upon reasonable prior n=
otice, have the right to inspect Licensee's and Licensee's Affiliates' reco=
rds, systems, and facilities, during normal business hours, to verify that =
Licensee's and its Affiliates' use of the Programs is in conformity with va=
lid licenses and otherwise comply with this Agreement. If a verification di=
scloses that Licensee's or any of its Affiliates' use is not in conformity =
with a valid license, Licensee shall immediately take all necessary steps t=
o cure any past defaults, including paying any unpaid license fees, to brin=
g Licensee's or any of its Affiliates' use into conformity.

 in some cases the Licensed User. During activation, data about the Program=
s and the Computer will be transmitted to MathWorks. This data includes the=
 License information, Computer identification, and location. Some License O=
ptions may require the MathWorks Account information and the operating syst=
em user name for the Licensed User. A License file will be provided to comp=
lete activation.

23. HEADINGS. The inclusion of headings is for convenience of reference onl=
y and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of this Agreement=
.

24. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement, and any applicable Addendum thereto i=
ncluding any documents referenced therein are incorporated herein by refere=
nce, and contain the entire understanding of the parties and may not be mod=

This is an Addendum to The MathWorks, Inc. Software License Agreement (the =
"Agreement"), and the terms and conditions of this Addendum are incorporate=
d therein for use of the Programs. Each capitalized term used herein and no=
t defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to it in the Agreement.

1. PURPOSES. The Agreement contains restrictions prohibiting Licensee from =
modifying, distributing, or providing access to the Programs or any Program=
 Components (as defined below), except as expressly provided in this Addend=
um. Because the Programs licensed by Licensee under the Agreement contain S=
ource Code or Object Code Program Components, this Addendum sets forth the =
Licensee's rights with respect to creating software or applications using t=
he Programs or any Program Component, as well as certain additional obligat=
ions related thereto. This Addendum also states restrictions and obligation=
s with respect to the use of the Programs or any Program Component, which a=
lso may have a bearing on the creation or distribution of software or appli=
cations.

MathWorks or its Licensors retain all right, title, and interest in its Pro=
grams, Program Components, and Derivative Forms of its Programs.

2. USER CREATED FILES. This Addendum does not apply to MATLAB code files, S=
imulink model files, MEX-files, MAT-files, VHDL-files, Verilog-files, FIG-f=
iles and P-files that are created by Licensee and that do not include any c=
ode obtained from MATLAB code files, Simulink model files, MAT-files, P-cod=
e, C/C++ files, VHDL-files, Verilog-files, TLC-files, or other Source Code =
files supplied with the Programs ("User Files"). Licensee may distribute or=
 sublicense without restriction, User Files provided that a principal purpo=
se of the distribution or sublicense is not to replace or replicate a Progr=
am or any part of a Program.

3. NONCOMPETITION. Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreemen=
t, Licensee agrees not to use, test, benchmark, reverse engineer or determi=
ne the expression or design of, the Programs, Derivative Forms, Generated F=
orms, or Program Components to make, or distribute its own or a Third Party=
's application or software, a principal purpose of which, as reasonably det=
ermined by MathWorks, is to perform the same or similar functions as Progra=
ms licensed by MathWorks or which replaces any component of the Programs. L=
icensee shall not otherwise use the Programs to compete with the products o=
r businesses of MathWorks, including by distributing Libraries, or any form=
 of an entire Program or a substantial portion of a Program.

4. DEFINITIONS.

4.1. Application. A software file that Licensee has created by either (a) u=
sing a MathWorks Program to compile or translate Licensee created Source Co=
de or (b) incorporating or linking any part of any Source Code, library fil=
e, or other Program Component provided with the Program. An Application mus=
t contain original code developed by Licensee and must provide substantial =
functionality not contained in, or provided by, the Program Components that=
 are incorporated into such Application. If a software file created by a Li=
censee incorporates Program Components, but does not meet the requirements =
of the previous sentence, then it is a Derivative Form (as defined below). =
An Application may contain Linked Object Code which, if such Object Code wa=
s not Linked to the Application and was a standalone file, would otherwise =
have been deemed a Derivative Form.

4.2. Application License. A license provided by Licensee to its end-users f=
or the installation and use of Licensee's Application and any Third Party S=
oftware made available for use with the Application.

4.3. Generated Forms. The output of the MATLAB Compiler, the MathWorks Code=
r Programs, and other MathWorks' code generation Programs in the form of So=
urce Code or Object Code, as well as such Source Code converted to Object C=
ode or Linked forms.

4.4. Derivative Forms. A software file that Licensee has derived from one o=
r more Program Components (including without limitation by incorporating, t=
ranslating, or modifying, in whole or in part, any Program Component), and =
which, if modified or copied without MathWorks' authorization, would consti=
tute a copyright infringement or breach of the Agreement. A software file c=
reated by Licensee which qualifies as an "Application" under the above defi=
nition shall not be deemed a Derivative Form.

4.5. Linked. An executable or loadable file created by a compiler or linker=
 program combining Object Code module files.

4.6. MAT-file. The file format in which MATLAB stores data.

ludes "Object Code libraries" and "shared libraries," which are groupings o=
f Object Code for specific purposes.

4.9. Program Component. Any portion of, or file provided with, a Program.

4.10. Source Code. Human-readable program code written in a higher-level la=
nguage such as C, C++, Java, MATLAB, MDL, VHDL, Verilog, or Fortran, which =

5.2.8. Licensee may not modify or remove any proprietary notice or license =
file that is included with the MATLAB Runtime.

5.3. Simulink Desktop Real-Time. Licensee may not incorporate Simulink Desk=
top Real-Time into an Application for deployment without contracting with M=
athWorks for an OEM or VAR agreement.

5.4. Simulink Real-Time. Licensee may develop Applications that incorporate=
 Object Code derived from Program Components of Simulink Real-Time which ar=
e required for the Application and that have been compiled or otherwise obt=
ained from Simulink Coder on a single development PC, download that Applica=
tion to a target PC, and distribute that Application beyond the target PC.

No further fees shall be due to MathWorks for such distribution of Licensee=

ivative Form to Third Parties (a) to the extent expressly permitted under A=
rticles 5 or 6 of this Addendum, or (b) subject to the requirements of this=
 Article 7. A Licensee may only distribute a Derivative Form to a Third Par=
ty under this Article 7 if such Third Party is bound by a Software License =
Agreement with MathWorks that requires such Third Party to treat such Deriv=
ative Forms received from Licensee as such Third Party's own Derivative For=
m thereunder. Licensee agrees that if such a Third Party provides Licensee =
with software that is a Derivative Form under the terms of such Third Party=
's Software License Agreement with MathWorks (or would otherwise be a Deriv=
ative Form under the terms of this Agreement), then Licensee shall treat su=
ch software as a Derivative Form hereunder as if Licensee has modified or g=
enerated the software itself.

8. WEB APPLICATIONS. Programs licensed under the Network Concurrent User, t=
he Network Named User, and the Standalone Named User Activation Types may b=
e called by means of a web interface in accordance with the following condi=
tions. Programs licensed under any other Activation Type may not be called =
via a web interface.

For the Network Concurrent User Activation Type. Programs licensed under th=
e Network Concurrent User Activation Type may be called via a web applicati=
on, provided the web application does not provide access to the MATLAB comm=
and line, or any of the licensed Programs with code generation capabilities=
. In addition, Licensed Users may not provide access to an entire Program o=
r a substantial portion of a Program, nor may such application enable evalu=
ation of end-user code or expressions. Such operation of an application via=
 a web interface may be provided to an unlimited number of web browser clie=
nts, at no additional cost, for Licensee's own use for its Internal Operati=
