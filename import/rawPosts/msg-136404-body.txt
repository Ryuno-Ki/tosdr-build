I recently went to a convention where everyone was given a flier for a
company called One More Story Games (https://onemorestorygames.com) that is
running a writing contest. While at first glance their rules seem entirely
reasonable, on a second page (the publishing agreement:
https://onemorestorygames.com/publishing-agreement/) the third term states
that you must waive your moral rights to your work.

3.     WAIVER OF MORAL RIGHTS

You hereby waive any and all moral rights that you may have in the Work,
and in any works created by OMSG or its licensees and assigns that
incorporate any element of the Work (including, in both cases, in all
literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works, and other
copyright-protectable works contained in the Work) and any similar rights
granted under the laws of any jurisdiction to the extent such rights may be
waived.


I didn't understand what this meant until a friend explained it to me, and
I feel like a lot of people will not even go to this page at all. Please
add an entry to TOS;DR.


Thanks!
