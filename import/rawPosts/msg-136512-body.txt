After agreeing to a $13M settlement over the "add connection" feature, 
LinkedIn announces imminent changes to its privacy policy.

*BEFORE: The issue: the reminder emails (LinkedIn users were not aware that 
they consented to reminder emails being sent)*
When you used the "add connection" feature to invite people who do not have 
a LinkedIn account, it sent a first "I'd like to add you to my professional 
network on LinkedIn" email and when the invitation was not accepted it sent 
two "reminder emails".


*NOW: The policy change: *This message now appears when you are about to 
invite people who do not have a LinkedIn account

> Invite friends, colleagues, and acquaintances who might like to connect, 
> and would benefit from joining LinkedIn. *If someone you invite doesn't 
> respond right away, we'll send up to two reminders.*




*PS: By the end 2015, LinkedIn plans to allow its users to disable the 
reminders function. *
