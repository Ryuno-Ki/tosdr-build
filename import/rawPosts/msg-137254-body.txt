I'm not sure how legal this part of the EULA is: "When you are using the
Software, the Software may monitor your computer's random access memory
(RAM) for unauthorized third party programs prohibited by Section III.E
that interact with the Software and/or the Game. In the event that the
Software detects such an unauthorized third party program, information may
be communicated back to Riot Games, including the name of your Account,
your internet protocol (IP) address, details about the unauthorized third
party program detected, and the time and date that the unauthorized third
party program was detected, along with the hardware specs and performance
characteristics of your computer, with or without additional notice to you.
No other information about you or your computer will be communicated to
Riot Games with the Software. If the Software detects the use of an
unauthorized third party program, your access to the Game may be terminated
with or without additional notice to you."
