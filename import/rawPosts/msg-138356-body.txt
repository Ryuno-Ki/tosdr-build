Hello,
as told by the firefox plugin Terms of service, I will write down all=20
points of the terms of service of accounts.firefox.com.

Link to the terms:
localiced version: https://accounts.firefox.com/legal/terms
english version:=20
https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/legal/terms/firefox-hello/

negative points:

  * point 5 does contain a different meaning in the german translation.
    That is a bad thing, as the user relies on the translation. Also
    some other places have different content. E.g. point 7: At a glance
    at the german translation you can see, that it has one paragraph
    less than the english version!
  * point 5 is only bad in the german translation. There is told, that
    the users contents can be used for free by Mozilla
      o english original text: "You hereby grant Mozilla and our
        licensors all rights necessary*to provide the Service*"
      o german text in my translation: By uploading of content you grant
        us a not exclusive, free of charge and worldwide licence for
        using your contents *in* *conjunction with* the provition of the
        services.
      o (german original text: "Durch das Hochladen von Inhalten
        erteilen Sie uns eine nicht ausschlie=C3=9Fliche, geb=C3=BChrenfrei=
e und
        weltweite Lizenz zur Nutzung Ihrer Inhalte in Verbindung mit der
        Bereitstellung der Services.")
  * point 10: the modifications are posted (in not further specified)
    blogs and forums. not a place, where users normally see it. instead
    the user could be asked directly in firefox, or when using the
    service the next time.
  * at point 11 is written that in case differences between the
    translated terms of service and the english version, the english
    version is valuable. This is ok, but they don't provide a link to
    the english version.

Best wishes
Chris
