[Modification of these Terms of Service]

"If Twitch changes these Terms of Service, we will provide you notice of
these changes, such as by sending an email, posting a notice on the Twitch
Service or updating the "Last Updated" date above."


this is a common bad policy as it is far to vauge and leaves room for
shenanigans

{such as in chapter one of}

[the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy]

(the vogon said after noticing the panic caused by their announcement of
earths impending demolition)

"There's no point in acting all surprised about it. All the planning charts
and demolition orders have been on display in your local planning
department on Alpha Centauri for fity of your Earth years, so you've had
plenty of time to lodge any formal complaint and it's far too late to start
making a fuss about it now."
