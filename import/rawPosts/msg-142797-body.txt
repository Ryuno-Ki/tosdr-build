Dear tosdr,

Please review the terms for RingPlus at=20
https://ringplus.net/legal/members/.

I had a few concerns when reading the terms. First of all, the terms,=20
service, pricing, can change at any time for any reason, and they can=20
change your phone's software remotely and without notice.

Second, it appears they have severe restrictions on the use of their=20
content, and claims & restrictions on your own content.

Please see below for relevant sections.

Thanks!
Jeff
