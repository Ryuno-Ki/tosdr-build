What would the reason for "YouTube may at any time, without prior notice...=
 remove such Content and/or terminate a user's account for submitting such =
material in violation of these Terms of Service."

Should the complainant have the reason given to the alleged perpetrator of =
rule violation? after all, being barred from your account due to some unkno=
wn reason may not deter one from creating another account, does it not?
