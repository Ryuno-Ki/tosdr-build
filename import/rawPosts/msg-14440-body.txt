Sorry to drag up a very old thread, but this question of ToS / UI rating is=
 interesting to me. I think ToSDR should stay focused on ToS and privacy po=
licies only. There could be other services which rate a user interface for =
how devious / manipulative / incompetently designed it is. In fact, there i=
s a website which already attempts to do this:

http://darkpatterns.org/

Similar to ToSDR, it attempts to catalogue (partly through crowd-sourcing) =
all the examples of user interfaces which are designed to trick the user to=
 doing something they don't want to do.

These are two seperate services requiring different considerations. However=
, I can see MUCH value in say, a browser plugin which would aggregate both =
a website's score from ToSDR and darkpatterns into one informative overall =
rating, or combine an explanation of the worst policy terms and the worst a=
spects of the user interface into one concise warning that pops up when I v=
isit the website.
