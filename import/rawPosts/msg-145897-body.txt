In order to keep the forums growing and to prevent conflicts we have
created some rules for the site. These rules were created to help limit
the flaming and common disagreements that can occur on public forums.
They are also a way to ensure that we do not offend other users.

General Rules:

1. Attacks - As with any large groups of people there will be
disagreements. This is understandable, but we will not tolerate flaming
other members. We are all adults and in such should be able to keep our
emotions in check. There will not be any personal/insulting attacks or
inflammatory posts. You can disagree, but do it politely.

2. Language - No dirty language. We are trying to create a place where
you don=E2=80=99t have to worry if your child is sitting next to you while
reading. Please keep your language clean. The friendly workarounds on
using crude language will not be tolerated also. We are not talking
about damn, hell, and other small ones, we are talking about the major
ones and you know what they are.

3. Opposite Sex - We are starting to pick up more female users. These
females offer an insight that we =E2=80=9Cmales=E2=80=9D cannot offer, so m=
ake sure to
keep derogatory comments about the opposite sex in check. If you are not
willing to say it face to face, don=E2=80=99t think it is ok from behind th=
e
keyboard.

4. Post Count - You want to up your membership status, please help us
out by saying hello to new members. No multiple or repeat postings to
get your post count up.

5. Advertising =E2=80=93 There are many users that want to advertise their
products or products of others. If you are not a contributing member to
the forum these advertisements will not be tolerated. For those who are
promoting products please ensure they are related to the 2nd Amendment.

6. Accounts =E2=80=93 You are only allowed one account. If your account is
suspended or deleted you are not allowed to create another account. If
multiple accounts are discovered they will be deleted!

7. Content =E2=80=93 This site is for the carrying of firearms for personal
protection and the protection of the 2nd Amendment. There are many
issues out there that can get out of hand real quick. Keep this in mind
when opening a thread that does not contain pertinent info to the site=E2=
=80=99s
purpose. We will keep a close eye on threads that run the risk of
getting out of hand quickly and will close it down if it starts going
bad. Do not create a thread or post about anything illegal such as
carrying concealed illegally. Your thread/post will be deleted and you
will be warned.

8. Photos - Members are allowed and encouraged to post on topic
pictures. Please keep your picture appropriate and clean. Photos that
are considered inappropriate will be removed and you will be notified of
such. If this problem continues you will risk having your account
suspended or deleted. This includes your avatar.

are getting out of hand we will have to jump in and give warnings, close
threads, or suspend/delete accounts.

    <p> In order to keep the forums growing and to prevent conflicts we
      have created some rules for the site. These rules were created to
      help limit the flaming and common disagreements that can occur on
      public forums. They are also a way to ensure that we do not offend
      other users.<br>
      <br>
      General Rules:<br>
      <br>
      1. Attacks - As with any large groups of people there will be
      disagreements. This is understandable, but we will not tolerate
      flaming other members. We are all adults and in such should be
      able to keep our emotions in check. There will not be any
      personal/insulting attacks or inflammatory posts. You can
      disagree, but do it politely.<br>
      <br>
      2. Language - No dirty language. We are trying to create a place
      where you don=E2=80=99t have to worry if your child is sitting next t=
o you
      while reading. Please keep your language clean. The friendly
      workarounds on using crude language will not be tolerated also. We
      are not talking about damn, hell, and other small ones, we are
      talking about the major ones and you know what they are.<br>
      <br>
      3. Opposite Sex - We are starting to pick up more female users.
      These females offer an insight that we =E2=80=9Cmales=E2=80=9D cannot=
 offer, so
      make sure to keep derogatory comments about the opposite sex in
      check. If you are not willing to say it face to face, don=E2=80=99t t=
hink
      it is ok from behind the keyboard.<br>
      <br>
      4. Post Count - You want to up your membership status, please help
      us out by saying hello to new members. No multiple or repeat
      postings to get your post count up. <br>
      <br>
      5. Advertising =E2=80=93 There are many users that want to advertise =
their
      products or products of others. If you are not a contributing
      member to the forum these advertisements will not be tolerated.
      For those who are promoting products please ensure they are
      related to the 2nd Amendment.<br>
      <br>
      6. Accounts =E2=80=93 You are only allowed one account. If your accou=
nt is
      suspended or deleted you are not allowed to create another
      account. If multiple accounts are discovered they will be deleted!<br=
>
      <br>
      7. Content =E2=80=93 This site is for the carrying of firearms for
      personal protection and the protection of the 2nd Amendment. There
      are many issues out there that can get out of hand real quick.
      Keep this in mind when opening a thread that does not contain
      pertinent info to the site=E2=80=99s purpose. We will keep a close ey=
e on
      threads that run the risk of getting out of hand quickly and will
      close it down if it starts going bad. Do not create a thread or
      post about anything illegal such as carrying concealed illegally.
      Your thread/post will be deleted and you will be warned.<br>
      <br>
      8. Photos - Members are allowed and encouraged to post on topic
      pictures. Please keep your picture appropriate and clean. Photos
      that are considered inappropriate will be removed and you will be
      notified of such. If this problem continues you will risk having
      your account suspended or deleted. This includes your avatar.<br>
      <br>
      These are some of the basic rules to govern the forums. We cannot
      think of everything so we reserve the right to create new rules or
      contact you on a case by case base. Remember keep it civil and be
      nice. If things are getting out of hand we will have to jump in
      and give warnings, close threads, or suspend/delete accounts.<br>
