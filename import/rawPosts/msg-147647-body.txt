Fair point! But I think it depends on how you describe the service youtube 
offers - is it a tool for publishing content (in which case it's indeed 
quite common that they may unpublish your content if they decide it 
violates their rules), or is it also a tool for:

* online storage of video-data (in which case unannounced account deletion 
can lead to you losing valuable data which you thought was safely stored 
there),
* sharing videos with a smaller audience (in which case you may find it 
intrusive that they scan your content and selectively deny access to 
specific users),
* a channel for free speech / journalism (in which case account deletion 
can be seen as censorship).

I'll have a look at how we rated sole-discretion account deletion for other 
services and get back to this thread.


Cheers!
Michiel.
