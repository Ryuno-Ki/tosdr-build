Thanks for posting this! I think the interpretation is a bit tricky there - 
initially I would say on the one hand you could read that they only do the 
payment processing - "collect" your creditcard number because you type it 
into their website, "analyze" whether your CVC code is correct, and "relay" 
the payment information to your bank and back to the Professional who gets 
paid. Especially the 'This means...' preamble implies that payment 
processing is the sole reason for the activities described, i.e. what they 
collect, analyze and relay, is all "in connection with these payments". Of 
course, "in connection with" is a broad term but a willing reader would 
probably interpret this as "needed for" these payments.

However, on second read, you could also interpret it as the "in connection 
with" phrase to apply to "information generated", and then it does not 
restrict the scope of the described activity at all. The "analyze" could 
cover all sorts of privacy-invading practices, and the "relay" part does 
not specify if they relay only to your bank and the bank of the 
Professional, or also to advertisers who pay for this data. So I think this 
phrasing is at least dodgy enough to raise a flag. I'll contact StyleSeat 
to see if they're available for comments / would care to clarify what they 
mean with that paragraph.

Thanks again for bringing this up, Stephon!

Cheers,
Michiel.
