Hey Roy, I was pretty surprised that tos;dr mentions "Google will share you=
r personal information with other parties." I think, and hope, this isn't t=
rue and especially the wording 'will' makes the statement a pretty hard one=
.

For me, this is the most important part of any privacy statement. Google ca=
n gather large amounts of info, but if that info stays within Google and is=
 used only for its services, I'm not particularly concerned. Unless there w=
ould be a security breach, of course, which I don't see coming any time soo=
n.

So, for tos;dr to have this wrong would be pretty serious. See these pages,=
 for example:

https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/143031?hl=3Den

Here they say they'll share info like your name and e-mailadres, but only a=
fter asking for your permission. This applies to Google Sign-in mostly, I g=
uess.

These two Mashable articles about the 2012 privacy policy update mention th=
e aggregated user info, but say Google doesn't share your information with =
advertisers. Apparently they 'hacked' through the new document. They also m=
ention the confidential info opt-in, but from a different perspective. They=
 say you'd have to opt in for <i>Google</i> to get this information.

http://mashable.com/2012/03/01/google-privacy-data-policy/
http://mashable.com/2012/01/25/google-privacy-update/

Personally, I don't think Google shares personal info with third parties, b=
ut rather lets them rely on the AdWords infrastructure. This would make sen=
se, of course from a privacy perspective, but also from the client's perspe=
ctive. Why try to filter through the info yourself when you can let Google =
do the work for you?

This of course, is speculation.
