> Twitch may allow advertisers, third-party advertising networks and third-=
party advertising serving companies to serve advertisements directly to you=
 within the Twitch Service and other Twitch sites, services and software. B=
y serving these advertisements directly to you, these companies can set the=
ir own cookies on your computer and trigger their own Web beacons and other=
 tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements=
, and to collect and track information such as demographic information, inf=
erred interests, aggregated information, and activity to assist them in per=
sonalizing the advertising content delivered to you. Twitch does not provid=
e your personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers =
or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advert=
iser asks Twitch to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for exampl=
e, males age 15 to 18) or audience segment (for example, males age 15 to 18=
 who have participated in certain promotions) and you respond to that adver=
tisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the descrip=
tion of the audience that they were trying to reach.=20

Advertisments can be served through third parties. These third parties do n=
ot receive data from twitch directly, only the request to serve an advert. =
These third parties may track you. The request to serve may be targeted to =
a specific age-group potentially allowing the third party to categorize you=
.


[Good] The description of notice of twitch is very good and specific.
