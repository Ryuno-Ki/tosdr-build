You're using terms like "illegal use" and "illegal content." I do not think 
that means what you think it means.

This would be a good deal more effective if you explained *why* you thought 
certain Terms of Service, and the statements in them, were "illegal," 
rather than simply stating that they are. It would be *even more* effective 
if you actually pointed to an example of any Terms of Service agreement 
anywhere ever that contained language such as "We Own You and everything 
about You" or "Copyright, Trademark, Criminal, and Civil Laws do not apply 
to us."
