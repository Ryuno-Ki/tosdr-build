Easynews state one thing about retention, but it doesn't appear to be the
case.  See emails below in relation to the online policy link:-

http://www.easynews.com/privacypolicy.html

I think it's important that subsscribers appreciate this.

Greetings,

  We retain account usernames and passwords and the account's remaining gig
balance so that if a customer returns, they can retain their gig balance.

  After 1 year, our systems will generally purge an account's remaining gig
balance, but this does not always happen, due to various reasons
server-side. If you have any questions, or need any further assistance,
please let us know.

Hi,

I'd like to sign up to your service again.  However I was surprised to see
that you still retained my user details when I tried using my old user name
"*****", which is handy, but...

I read in your policy:-

"Registration information will be kept on-file to support the registered
account for the duration of the customer relationship with Easynews."

But this doesn't appear to be the case.  Our relationship ended years ago.

Can you explain this?

Kindest Regards,
Steve
