Hi, I have been looking through this as we are building a new WP site.
We have taken steps to integrate social media without giving access by
facebook for tracking etc but are concerned about gravatar (which is now
a really core feature of WP). Gravatar seems to be all over the web, it
gets blocked as if it were tracking by services like ghostry.

In the TOS here: https://en.gravatar.com/site/terms-of-service I see:

"Automattic may update the Gravatar Terms from time to time. Your
continued use of the Services following notification of such updates
constitutes your acceptance of those changes."

"More specifically, you hereby do and shall grant to Automattic a
worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free and fully-paid,
transferable (including rights to sublicense) right to perform the
Services (e.g., to use, modify, reproduce, distribute, prepare
derivative works of, display, perform, and otherwise fully exercise and
exploit all intellectual property, publicity, and moral rights with
respect to any User Submissions, and to allow others to do so)."

which horrible. The TOS are really short becuase they supplement the
wordpress.com ones (which don't look atrocious on TOS:DR)

I am not sure how to proceed. How do I find out if Gravatar is being
used to gather and sell data? Also, I would like to help update the
TOS:DR gravatar entry if needed. I think the first point gets an orange
thumb, not sure about point two - might already be on there.

Anna

(ps: hey Hugo, it's Anna from FSFE!)
