A clarification: the reason for ToS:DR isn't *to expose* anybody at all. 
It's to inform users about their rights under the terms of use agreements 
they're asked to agree to. 

"No refund" policies are legal as long as they're clearly and conspicuously 
marked prior to purchase (and the law assumes, rightly or wrongly, that 
consumers read the terms of use agreements prior to using a website, so are 
informed about policies like this prior to purchase). Also, a "no refund" 
policy like this one is very common for a prepaid, recurring service like 
Dropbox's: it's rare to find a similar service that *does* offer refunds. 

Let me explain why: let's say you're a small business owner. You offer a 
service online where users can sign up and pay for each month in advance, 
on a recurring basis. A user signs up at the end of January and pre-pays 
for February. On February 27, after nearly a full month of use, the user 
cancels his account and demands a refund. Here's another example: let's say 
you're a small business owner. You offer a service online where users can 
*either* have a free account that comes with a monthly data cap, or they 
can have a paid account that has no data cap. A user signs up for the paid 
service and pre-pays for February. By February 4, the user has transmitted 
more data than he would have been able to with a free account. On February 
5, the user cancels his account and demands a refund, arguing that he 
hasn't used it for a full month and should be credited for the unused 
time...however, he has clearly gotten full use out of the paid service. 
Enough issues like these crop up, and businesses simply adopt a "No 
refunds" policy.

Of course, some businesses do offer refunds on a discretionary basis. Not 
all do, though, and it doesn't make a business necessarily *bad* if it 
chooses not to.
