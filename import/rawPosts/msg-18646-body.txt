Hi Terms of Service; Didn't Read,

I found some information on *Kik Messenger'*s Terms and Conditions at
http://kik.com/legal/
Here it is: *Kik Messenger (bad) has your permission to disclose your
personal information to a third party without your consent.*
This shortened version of their terms covers 4.5 and 4.6 in Disclosures &
Transfers in their Terms and Conditions under Privacy.
I think this is bad because you don't know where and to whom your
information could be handed away to and this places users at risk.

Thanks!
