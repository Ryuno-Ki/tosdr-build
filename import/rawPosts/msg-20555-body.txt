Hello,
I think startpage.com is one of the best alternatives to Google when it com=
es to privacy. Please find some quotes from their privacy policy below:

"StartPage is strongly committed to=20
protecting the privacy of its user community. This privacy policy=20
details the - very limited and non-personal - information Startpage.com=20
("StartPage") may gather and our disclosure policy."

Governmental requests

"StartPage is headquartered in The Netherlands, Europe. Any request or dema=
nd from any government (including the US) to deliver user data, will be tho=
roughly checked by our lawyers, and we will not comply unless the law which=
 actually applies to us would undeniably require it from us. And even in th=
at hypothetical situation, we would refer to the fact we have no personal u=
ser data to share. In the fourteen years we've been in business, we have ne=
ver received such a request."

"The only legitimate way that we see to make us start collecting personal i=
nformation, is if there is a valid warrant or court order, obliging us to d=
o so in relation to a specific user because that person is suspected to hav=
e committed a crime which is serious enough to warrant such a restriction o=
f privacy."
