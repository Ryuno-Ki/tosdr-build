I have read the Mozilla privacy policy and would like to contribute to the =
Terms of Service; Didn't Read webpage.  I will copy and paste parts that se=
em suspicious (in my views), and will also post favorable things in the pol=
icy (also in my perspective).  The full terms of service can be found in ht=
tps://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/

We're a global organization and our computers are in several different=20
places around the world. We also use service providers whose computers=20
may also be in various countries. This means that your information might
 end up on one of those computers in another country, and that country=20
may have a different level of data protection regulation than yours. By=20
giving us information, you consent to this kind of transfer of your=20
information. No matter what country your information is in, we comply=20
with applicable law and will also abide by the commitments we make in=20
this privacy policy.

When the law requires it. We follow the law whenever we receive requests
 about you from a government or related to a lawsuit. We'll notify you=20
when we're asked to hand over your personal information in this way=20
unless we're legally prohibited from doing so. When we receive requests=20
like this, we'll only release your personal information if we have a=20
good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. Nothing in this=20
policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you=20
may have to a third party's request to disclose your information.

If our organizational structure or status changes (if we undergo a=20
restructuring, are acquired, or go bankrupt) we may pass your=20
information to a successor or affiliate.

Here are some good things in their privacy statement:

We also don't want your personal information for any longer than we need
 it, so we only keep it long enough to do what we collected it for. Once
 we don't need it, we take steps to destroy it unless we are required by
 law to keep it longer.

If we store your personal information with information that is=20
non-personal, we will consider the combination as personal information.=20
If we remove all personal information from a set of data then the=20
remaining is non-personal information.

Since Mozilla is an organization, they have many services that each have th=
eir own privacy policy. If you would like me to review the others, please s=
end me an email.  Thanks!
