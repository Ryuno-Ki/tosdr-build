While things like "We are committed to being transparent and open" don't=20
necessarily mean much on their own, I disagree that they don't hold water=
=20
at all. A privacy policy is *a company's promise to its users*, and any=20
statement in a privacy policy is a promise...a *legal* promise (in other=20
words, it's a unilateral contract). So when a company says, in a privacy=20
policy, "We are committed to being transparent and open," that's actually a=
=20
promise it's making, and it can find itself in trouble if it comes out,=20
later, that its actions have not been transparent and open.

This has been made very clear in the recent *FTC v. Wyndham Hotels* decisio=
n,=20
where Wyndham's privacy policy promised that it cared a lot about its=20
guests' privacy, and used "industry standard practices" to secure personal=
=20
information, and made all reasonable efforts to protect privacy, etc etc.=
=20
But they had unpatched systems, systems with default admin passwords, and=
=20
all kinds of terrible security practices, so over the course of two years=
=20
they were hacked three times (but still left their systems unpatched). The=
=20
FTC went after them for unfair and deceptive business practices, saying,=20
look, if you've *promised* that you use industry standard practices to=20
protect personal information, and you're clearly not using industry=20
standard practices or taking reasonable efforts to protect your systems=20
from intrusion, then your promise is deceptive. You can't just lie.

I know this is a bit of a tangent to go into on this forum over something=
=20
minor like the promise to be transparent and open, but I think it's worth=
=20
considering that as we look at terms of service and privacy policies, we're=
=20
looking at *promises*. Enforceable promises. Sometimes they're promises the=
=20
user is making to the company, but sometimes they're promises the company=
=20
is making to the user. They're not just puffery. Puffery goes elsewhere.
