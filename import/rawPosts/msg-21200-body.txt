That's not bad. That's good, and completely normal. You'll see a clause 
like this in every Terms of Service agreement out there (and if you don't, 
somebody's done something wrong).

All this says is that if *you* do something illegal, or that harms someone 
else, while you happen to be using IFTTT or developing recipes using IFTTT, 
and that other person sues IFTTT (maybe because they can't find you, or 
don't know who you are, or just don't know how the internet works), then 
you agree to step up and defend IFTTT. 

That's reasonable, right? Let's say Bob is a total stalker and writes an 
IFTTT recipe to check Twitter for every mention of some actress's name, and 
every time she's mentioned it posts a super creepy harassing tweet to her, 
so she's just spammed with nastiness. She complains to Twitter, and Twitter 
tells her they're coming from IFTTT, so she sues IFTTT to make them stop. 
Well, IFTTT shouldn't be on the hook for that lawsuit, obviously. Bob 
should. Bob's the creepy psycho misusing the service.

And that's good, because without clauses like that, new little companies 
couldn't exist...they'd drown in legal fees every time some idiot user did 
something stupid with their service.
