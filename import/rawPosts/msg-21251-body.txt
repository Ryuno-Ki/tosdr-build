Here it is for www.king.com, the homesite of King Digital (Candy Crush
Saga).

Their terms are here: https://king.com/#!/termsAndConditions

Quotable Quotes:


1. In relation to refunds:* "all sales by us to you of Virtual Money and
Virtual Goods are final and that we will not refund any transaction*"
2. On these goods: *"you do not own Virtual Goods or Virtual Money but
instead you purchase a limited personal revocable licence to use them"*

Plus some other stuff - they do not release rights in any way, they collect
your personal info (see below) and

*they will change their terms at any time by posting the new link in place
of the old - no notification required, though they may notify users.*


*Privacy *https://king.com/#!/privacyPolicy

*- Will share information in some ways - with no name attached, to make
corporate documents (such as number of games played), as required by law or
with your approval. Or, "as we reasonably believe is permitted by law or
regulation"*

*- Uses cookies and other means of tracking*

*- Retain this information as long as necessary and indefinitely *


These are mostly negative points, though they did say they would protect
user information and anonymity.
