Of course, everything written in the privacy policy itself can be
used to make an argument before the courts.

Still, sentences such as=C2=A0=E2=80=9Cwe care about your privacy=E2=80=9D =
don=E2=80=99t hold
much water (which is not the same thing is not holding water at
all).

The fact that such sentences are often used at the beginning of
the privacy policies make them act like a preamble and it can be
reasonably argued that they are important in spirit.

But when the letter of the policy will later in the text
contradict the spirit of sentences such as "we care about your
priacy" what do you think is going to happen really? This is why I
would much rather focus on the concrete provisions on ToSDR and
not focus much on broad and possibly empty promises such as "we
care about your privacy."=20

It seems clear to me that the important part here clearly is
"industry standard practices" not "Wyndham cares about your
privacy".
