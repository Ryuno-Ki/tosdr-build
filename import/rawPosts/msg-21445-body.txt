Hi, Rita,

I understand you're frustrated. You've had a set of expectations that=20
haven't been met. However, I'm afraid those expectations aren't in line=20
with what TOS:DR is or promises. You're quite right: as we explain pretty=
=20
openly on the TOS:DR website <http://tosdr.org/get-involved.html>, this=20
project relies on community involvement. TOS:DR doesn't have *customers*;=
=20
it isn't a *company*. This is an open, peer-reviewed, public benefit=20
project that lots of people contribute to, in our spare time, to try to=20
help out other people. The TOS:DR team does its research as well, curates=
=20
and compiles the suggestions, compares data points, scores them, and=20
ultimately assigns certain terms with a badge=20
<http://tosdr.org/classification.html> so that ToS can be classified. As=20
the team explained on the website, this takes quite a lot of comparison, to=
=20
the point that even large companies's ToS agreements may not have=20
classifications because there aren't enough other data points to compare=20
them to <http://tosdr.org/blog/why-no-class-yet.html>.

I don't believe TOS:DR has ever made any promises to be something it is=20
not. It offers a rating system, sure, but it has only promised that a=20
rating will appear *if* you are browsing a website that has been classified=
=20
in the TOS:DR database. It has never promised that all websites, or even=20
most websites, appear in the TOS:DR database...because, according to Intern=
et=20
Live Stats <http://www.internetlivestats.com/total-number-of-websites/>,=20
there are just under a billion websites on the internet as of mid-2014.=20

I understand that it's frustrating when your expectations aren't met. I=20
hope I can, at least, help clarify what to expect, so you won't be=20
frustrated in the future. If you'd like to help make the TOS:DR database=20
stronger, that'd be fantastic. The more people who contribute, the more=20
everyone benefits.
