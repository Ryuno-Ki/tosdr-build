months ago, and have YET to have been helped by it. It appears that,

a rip-off of a service=E2=80=A6i.e., promise something, get nothing.

Hi, I have been coming back to this email in my mind a few times since I
first read it.

I have often found people to be surprised, even angered, by the idea of
"community involvement". I can never work out how many these people
simply don't understand what is before them and how many actually
disagree with the way "we" (Free Culture, Free Software etc etc) work in
our projects.

We now live in a world of /Wikipedia/ being the biggest website... is it
possible that people still don't understand?

As someone on "the inside" of so many of these communities, I don't
notice sometimes how far we still have to go to explain the idea that
"you can build something together that belongs to everyone" (and that
this does not constitute a con or exploitation).

This email from Rita had made me feel quite sad really

Anna
