Well, I think =E2=80=94 as with so many things =E2=80=94 it's a matter of s=
etting consumer=20
expectations. That's something that any of us who work with terms of=20
service and privacy policies should be sensitive to, maybe moreso than=20
anyone else, since *those* documents are all about setting user=20
expectations in a clear and understandable way...and of course people's=20
failure to do so leads to this project.

If users come into a product knowing what it is and what to expect from it,=
=20
they aren't negatively surprised by its normal behavior. I think in all the=
=20
press TOS:DR has gotten, some people have billed it as a cure-all, an easy=
=20
button that will read all terms of service for you and tell you in simple=
=20
terms what they say and whether or not you should trust them. That's not=20
what the project is, and that's not what the extension does. So it may be=
=20
worthwhile to clarify, on the download page, that this is part of an=20
ongoing community project to classify terms of service.

I mean...yes, TOS:DR says that in other places on the website, but we of=20
all people can hardly fault users for not reading all the words, can we?
