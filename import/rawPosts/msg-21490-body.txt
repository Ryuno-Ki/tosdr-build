Hello!

I'm so glad to see your movement!

I have a suggestion (don't know if it has been posted already): Why don't=
=20
you start writing guidelines for those who want to write legally correct=20
but still human-readable ToS? I've seen your Legal page, and it's really=20
nice. But if i have a service, how can i write something this short, while=
=20
being sure that i won't get into trouble?

What could be even cooler is to create ToS templates, like Creative Commons=
=20
did for licences. I mean, if i'm a developer of a service, i could assemble=
=20
a ToS from little pieces, something like "tosdr-nw-nhc", which would mean=
=20
No Warranties provided and No Harmful Content allowed. Of course, usually=
=20
there would be more pieces than just two. Then users would need to read the=
=20
respective rules only once.

What do you think?

Cheers,
Bern=C3=A1t
