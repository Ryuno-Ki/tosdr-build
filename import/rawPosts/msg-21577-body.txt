The subscription to the Community Edition of Zoominfo requires subscribers =
to provide unfettered access to their email address book.

Zoominfo then takes any "business-related" contact information from the sub=
scriber's address book and uses it to increase the "size and quality" of it=
s online database.

This is all stated in Zoominfo's "Privacy Policy" in which Zoominfo states =
that the policy "has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that the=
 privacy policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance w=
ith TRUSTe's program requirements including transparency, accountability an=
d choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information."

When one clicks on the Truste link, one gets the following message:

"This site is NOT CERTIFIED by TRUSTe."

Zoominfo provides subscribers with no choice other than to allow Zoominfo C=
ommunity Edition subscribers to provide unfettered access to their contacts=
 database. Only the "uninformed victims" of this exercise, ie the user's co=
ntacts, have the option to opt out but not until it is too late unless Zoom=
info proposes sending an email to each of them to inform them that unless t=
hey take some action they will be added to Zoominfo's database.

As is usually the case with dodgy terms of use, it would be VERY easy for t=
he service provider to make very plain, upfront in the sign on section of t=
he website the most offensive terms, eg=20

"By signing up to the Community Edition of Zoominfo you agree to allow Zoom=
info to mine your email address book for the information of your friends an=
d associates and anyone else in your address book and store that informatio=
n in our database for retrieval and display in our Zoominfo directory."=20

The warning  could be a lot more succinctly if preceded by the words "Cauti=
on".
