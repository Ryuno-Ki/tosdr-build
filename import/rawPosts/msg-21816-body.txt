thoughts:

1) even if you just visit the site you are bound by their tos even if
you haven't read them or signed anything

"By accessing and using the Services, you agree to comply with and be
bound by these Terms of Service, whether you are a "Member" (meaning
that you have registered ...and have created a "StumbleUpon Profile"),
or you are a "Visitor" (meaning you are simply browsing the StumbleUpon
website or viewing content from or affiliated with StumbleUpon)"

2) they will usually notify you of changes with note on site and an
email if you are a member. Continued use after notification is taken as
acceptance

3) Your StumbleUpon Profile may be deleted without warning if we have
reason to believe that you do not meet these eligibility requirements.
one of the requirments is that you have to provide accurate information
about yourself.

I ran out of energy now, anyone wonna take over for a bit?
