FEES section.

Any money you spend on an arc game is theirs at the time of the transaction
completion and they are not liable for any error's caused in game for you
to not receive what you paid for unless you have concrete proof of it
happening (which is nearly impossible unless you know what and when is
going to go wrong with the game) and even then is under their discretion to
correct the issue or not. If you attempt a charge back they will take you
to court.

It's bad, I bought $30 of in game currency, $10 of it was lost to a web
interface error and they said there was nothing they can do, read our terms
of service, and ignored me. So basically you take it on faith that
everything will work properly with their games and if it doesn't then you
lose your money for nothing.
