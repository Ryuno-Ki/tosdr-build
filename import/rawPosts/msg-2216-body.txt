i would guess you would probably end up in class A or B. Most things 
people write in their ToS are restrictions on the user's rights, 
although sometimes there are some commitments in there (positive 
points). So if you're the "default" case, then you would end up pretty 
high in the rankings, but not necessarily the very best one.
