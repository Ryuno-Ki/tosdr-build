Not sure if these should be in separate posts, but here goes.

The ToS states that all User Content "are subject, whether in whole or in 
part, to unlimited commercial, non-commercial and/or promotional use by 
Bertheussen IT". (http://wordfeud.com/tos/ under 4) Furthermore: "You 
hereby grant to Bertheussen IT a worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, 
non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid-up and royalty-free license, (with 
the right to sublicense), to use, copy, adapt, modify, distribute, license, 
sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, 
broadcast and otherwise exploit User Content you transmit or submit and all 
derivative works. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, you hereby 
waive any moral rights you may have in User Content."

Apparently all User Content can be used by Bertheussen IT in any thinkable 
way. This is perticularly relevant when it comes to in-game chats and 
uploaded pictures (avatars). On the upside, Bertheussen IT lets users keep 
their copyright according to this sentence: "You represent and warrant that 
User Content you transmit or submit is original to you and that you 
exclusively own the rights to such content". Not sure how the collision of 
these apply in practice.

Also, "User Content is not confidential and will not be returned to the 
user". Not sure what this is supposed to mean though.
