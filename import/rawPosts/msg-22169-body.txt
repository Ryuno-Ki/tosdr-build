The discussion that is linked to the Wordfeud page directs me to a post 
that has nothing to do with Wordfeud, so I thought it'd be better to make a 
new one.

ToSDR states that "It is impossible to delete your account from this 
service, according to the AccountKiller blacklist 
<http://www.accountkiller.com/en/Blacklist>."

Although it is indeed not possible to delete your account via a webpage, 
the ToS of Wordfeud (and AccountKiller) states that "You may terminate your 
account at any time and for any reason by sending an email to 
support@wordfeud.com". (See http://wordfeud.com/tos/ under par. 6) 
Therefore I wouldn't say that it is *impossible *to delete your 
Wordfeud-account. On the contrary, you're allowed to delete your account at 
all times.
