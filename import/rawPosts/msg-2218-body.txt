I agree with Michiel here. Although most ToS agreements are just spelling o=
ut restrictions of use, not having any could be both a good and bad thing. =
Users could run rampant with your service in a way you didn't intend, that =
is also harmful to other users, for example. I don't think that would be a =
good thing.
