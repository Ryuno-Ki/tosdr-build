This topic isn't about a website's ToS, but about what hopefully will be 
future European law. It's definitely about ToS;DR, so please read on ;)

Background: The European Council has proposed a General Data Protection 
Regulation in 2012 which will (hopefully) replace the current Directive 
95/46/EC, the core of European privacy law. A new version of this 
Regulation has been adopted by the European Parliament in may 2014. Now, 
the Council of the European Union will have to debate about this Regulation 
before the Regulation will become effective.

Anyway, part of this Regulation is art. 13a, which requires the controllers 
who are processing personal data to inform the data subjects (you and I) 
about their policies in very basic tables. It looks a bit like what Aza 
Raskin made with his Privacy Icons 
(http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/privacy-icons/). You can find art. 13a of 
the General Data Protection Regulation here: 
http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2009_2014/documents/libe/dv/comp_am_art_01-29/comp_am_art_01-29en.pdf 
(page 30). I want to emphasize that art. 13a may not be part of the final 
version of the Regulation, but for now it looks a like a (very) welcome 
addition for Europeans.
