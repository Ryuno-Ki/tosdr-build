Hm, on the other hand, they probably get a lot of people trying to 
compromise celebrity accounts, so maybe it's just their way of being 
cautious? I'm not sure whether we should immediately judge this as them 
trying to discourage you or being lazy about how they offer this data 
export service. In fact, faxes probably give them a lot of extra work, too. 
See also for instance 
https://blog.scraperwiki.com/2014/08/the-story-of-getting-twitter-data-and-its-missing-middle/ 
about the trade-off between API openness and user privacy that Twitter 
apparently deals with.

On the other hand, you're right that use of faxes and printed documents is 
really silly in this day and age - they could instead also just allow you 
to email a scanned copy of your passport as an attachment. I propose we 
give then the 40 positive points for allowing data export, but discount 
them 10 for requiring the use of fax technology (so a score of +30 instead 
of +40 in the end).
