Giving 'Third parties are bound by confidentiality obligations' a [good] 
score of +20 in the 'third' topic.

We should be aware that we should rate every service on this topic; it may 
be other services would really deserve those points too, but don't get them 
because they took this for granted as 'normal', and didn't bother 
mentioning it in their terms. I made a checklist that mentions this and 
some other points to keep in mind for a full review:
