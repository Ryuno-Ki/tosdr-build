Well, I suppose there must be drawbacks to laziness of leaving the page 
empty, of course :)
Still, I would appreciate a more precise answer...or that depends on the 
particular service?
Does it depend at all on the way I host the service (country, kind of 
users, ...)

Ian, can you explain further when you say: "Users could run rampant with 
your service in a way you didn't intend".

An important question I missed in my first email: can there be legal 
consequences to having an empty terms of services?

Thanks again,
Alessandro
