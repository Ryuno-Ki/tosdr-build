Hi,

 

https://accounts.firefox.com/legal/terms & also about:accounts

 

Below is the terms of service for creating an account to use "Firefox Sync".
Point 5 is wholly unacceptable. These are my bookmarks yet they are
effectively saying 1/ we can use them however we want and 2/ they better not
contain something we deem inappropriate!

 

Regards

Scott

Terms of Service


Last Updated March 26, 2014


Summary


This top section summarizes the terms below. This summary is provided to
help your understanding of the terms, but be sure to read the entire
document, because when you agree to it, you are indicating you accept all of
the terms, not just this summary.

*	Firefox cloud services (the "Services") are a suite of services
provided to you by Mozilla.
*	The Services are provided "as is" and there are no warranties of any
kind. There are significant limits on Mozilla's liability for any damages
arising from your use of the Services.


Terms of Service


1.      Introduction


These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of Firefox cloud services,
a suite of online services provided by Mozilla (the "Services").


2.      Firefox Accounts


In order to use the Services, you'll need to create a Firefox Account.
During registration, you will be asked to set a password. You are
responsible for keeping your password confidential and for the activity that
happens through your Firefox account. Mozilla is not responsible for any
losses arising out of unauthorized use of your Firefox account.


3.      Features


Firefox Sync lets you access information stored in Firefox across devices,
including your tabs, awesome bar, passwords, bookmarks, and browser
preferences. You can enable and disable Firefox Sync through the Tools
section of Firefox.


4.      Privacy Policy


The Firefox Cloud Services Privacy Notice
<http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox-cloud/>  describes details on
what we receive from your use of the Services and how we use that
information. We use the information we receive through the Services as
described in our Mozilla Privacy Policy <http://www.mozilla.org/privacy/> .


5.      Your Content in our Services


You may upload content as part of the features of the Services. By uploading
content, you hereby grant us a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license
to use your content in connection with the provision of the Services. You
hereby represent and warrant that your content will not infringe the rights
of any third party and will comply with any content guidelines presented by
Mozilla.


6.      Mozilla's Proprietary Rights


Mozilla does not grant you any intellectual property rights in the Services
that are not specifically stated in these Terms. For example, these Terms do
not provide the right to use any of Mozilla's copyrights, trade names,
trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand
features. The Services are distributed under and subject to the current
version of the Mozilla Public License <http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/> .


7.      Term; Termination


These Terms will continue to apply until ended by either you or Mozilla. You
can choose to end them at any time for any reason by deactivating your
Firefox account and discontinuing your use of the Services.

We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time for any
reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you
have violated these Terms, (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure
for us; or (iii) our provision of the Services to you is no longer
commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the
email address associated with your Firefox account or the next time you
attempt to access the Services.

In all such cases, these Terms shall terminate, including, without
limitation, your license to use the Services, except that the following
sections shall continue to apply: Indemnification, Disclaimer; Limitation of
Liability, Miscellaneous.


8.      Indemnification


You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Mozilla, its contractors,
contributors, licensors, and partners, and their respective directors,
officers, employees and agents ("Indemnified Parties") from and against any
and all third party claims and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising
out of or related to your use of the Services (including, but not limited
to, from any content uploaded by you).


9.      Disclaimer; Limitation of Liability


THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITH ALL FAULTS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
BY LAW, MOZILLA AND THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES,
WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES THAT THE
SERVICES ARE FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
AND NON-INFRINGING. YOU BEAR THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SELECTING THE SERVICES
FOR YOUR PURPOSES AND AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES,
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE RISK THAT YOUR CONTENT IS DELETED OR
CORRUPTED OR THAT SOMEONE ELSE ACCESSES YOUR ACCOUNT. THIS LIMITATION WILL
APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW, MOZILLA AND THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES WILL NOT BE
LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE USE OF
OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DIRECT AND
INDIRECT DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF
DATA, AND COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR
OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH SUCH CLAIM IS BASED. THE COLLECTIVE LIABILITY OF
MOZILLA AND THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED
$500 (FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS). SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.


10.  Modifications to these Terms


Mozilla may update these Terms from time to time to address a new feature of
the Services or to clarify a provision. The updated Terms will be posted
online. If the changes are substantive, we will announce the update through
Mozilla's usual channels for such announcements such as blog posts and
forums. Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of such
changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes. To make your review
more convenient, we will post an effective date at the top of this page.


11.  Miscellaneous


These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Mozilla
concerning the Services and are governed by the laws of the state of
California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of law provisions. If any portion
of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining
portions will remain in full force and effect. In the event of a conflict
between a translated version of these terms and the English language
version, the English language version shall control.
