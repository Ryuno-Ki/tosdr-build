All I can do here is speculate (again, this is in no way legal advice).

My assumption is that with something like an email service, there is an exp=
ectation of privacy. Each user expects that their unique username/password =
is protected and only accessible by them (in the simplest case scenario). T=
hus, if your servers were hacked and everyone's emails made public, I'd gue=
ss they'd be able to sue you.=20

I would consult a lawyer on this, though, to be sure. All I can do is specu=
late, as I am not a lawyer and thus can't give any kind of legal advice.=20
