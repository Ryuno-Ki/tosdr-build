I completely agree with Hugo, but because I do understand why there was 
some concern, let me take a moment to go through it. Let's *really* look at 
what they're asking for.

5.      Your Content in our Services
> You may upload content as part of the features of the Services. By 
> uploading content, you hereby grant us:
>  a nonexclusive, 
> royalty-free, 
> worldwide license 
> to use your content 
> in connection with the provision of the Services. 
> You hereby represent and warrant that your content will not infringe the 
> rights of any third party and will comply with any content guidelines 
> presented by Mozilla.


*Non-exclusive:* That means they're not the only person / group who gets to 
use it. So they're asking for the right to use it, but they're not asking 
to be the only people who get it. 
*Royalty-free:* They're not going to pay you for the content you upload.
*Worldwide:* They get to use and display the content all over the world 
(you know how sometimes you go to YouTube and you can't watch a video 
because you're not in the right country? Somebody doesn't have a worldwide 
license for that content. They want a worldwide license because they're a 
worldwide company offering their content worldwide).
*To use your content: *Frankly I kind of hate this, because "use" doesn't 
actually mean anything, but they're going for plain English, so good for 
them. I don't know if it would've made you feel better if they'd said "to 
reproduce, modify, distribute, display, and perform your content," but 
that's what they mean by "use."
*In connection with the provision of the Services: *They're only asking for 
this license in connection with their service. They're not going to go 
start up a side business selling your content in Dubai.
And...you're promising not to upload any infringing stuff, and to comply 
with the content guidelines.

That's pretty much one of the best license agreements I've ever seen, *and 
I write license agreements.*
