I see, sorry about that.
But i have to correct you on 1 point, i said that the TOS is NOT user
friendly meaning that it is hard to read, i might have written it unclearly
as English is not my native language, sorry about that too.

But yeah the only reason why i wrote that message is because on that page
it said that i should mail here with part of the TOS that would make it
negative or positive, thus i sent screenshot about uncleanness of the TOS.

I hope i wrote that correctly enough for you to understand.
