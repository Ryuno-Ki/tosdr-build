Hi,

We've noticed your recent pushes to tosdr-server on GitHub. Brilliant!

We would love to learn about your feelings related to developing software. =
Are happy developers more creative? Do you need a manager to keep you disci=
plined?

We would appreciate it if you would spend around 15 minutes to complete a s=
urvey on developers' feelings. With your help, we can contribute to improvi=
ng development practices and conditions for software developers.

Go to: https://www.esurveycreator.com/s/d85a687

We are conducting an academic study (Universities of Helsinki, Finland and =
Bozen-Bolzano, Italy) to investigate how software developers feel when they=
 develop software. We are contacting you because you provided a public e-ma=
il address in your GitHub profile. Hopefully, this did not annoy you. We pr=
omise never to contact you again regarding this study without your authoriz=
ation.

Your responses are voluntary and are kept strictly confidential. Responses =
will not be identified by individual. The information gathered through this=
 survey will only be used for non-commercial, academic research purposes. A=
ny published results will be based on anonymised data and it will not be po=
ssible to identify your individual responses.

At the end of the survey, you have the option to leave your email address i=
f you wish to be contacted for some follow-up questions. This is completely=
 optional. In case you decide to leave your e-mail address, we will not dis=
close your personal information or contact details to anybody.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact Daniel Graziotin (see=
 below).

Thank you in advance,=20
