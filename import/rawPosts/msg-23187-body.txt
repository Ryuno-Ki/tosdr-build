COMMENT: These sites are only Facebook partners (scribd, rotten tomatoes, e=
tc).

>The first time you visit a site or app using instant personalization, you =
>will see a notification letting you know that the site or app has partnere=
d >with Facebook to provide a personalized experience.

>>The notification will give you the ability to disable or turn off instant=
 >>personalization for that site or app. If you do that, that site or app i=
s >>required to delete all of the information about you it received from >>=
Facebook as part of the instant personalization program.
>> In addition, we will prevent that site from accessing your information i=
n >>the future, even when your friends use that site.

>If you decide that you do not want to experience instant personalization >=

COMMENT: Thus, you can turn off info sharing (so far, only on a case by cas=
e basis. Let's read on.

> If you turn off an instant personalization site or app after you have bee=
n >using it or visited it a few times (or after you have given it specific =
>permission to access your data), it will not automatically delete >informa=
tion about you it received through Facebook. Like all other apps, >the site=

 to do so.

COMMENT: Here I get somewhat confused; the first sentence suggests that the=
 site/app can keep your information if you've already given it permission, =
or if you have used it multiple times without withholding permission. Okay.=
 Then the second sentence says they're required to delete that information =
if you ask.
So, I suppose that means turning off personalization is NOT deleting the in=
formation which has already been given out. Deletion only happens when the =
site/app is expressly asked to delete your personal information. It seems y=
ou do this through Facebook, but how is anyone's guess.
