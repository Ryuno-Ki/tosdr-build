They automatically give your info to partner sites (from this I can't tell=
=20
if they share the info *when* you visit those sites or if those sites have=
=20
access to that information anyway. In any case, it seems the info they=20
share is more-or-less public anyway (see underlined above).

The first time you visit a site or app using instant personalization, you=

COMMENT: Thus, you can turn off info sharing (so far, it seems, only on a=
=20
case by case basis). If you turn off personalization via this notification,=
=20
the site/app is required to delete all the info it received from Facebook.

If you turn off an instant personalization site or app after you have been=

COMMENT: Here I get somewhat confused; the first sentence suggests that the=
=20
site/app can keep your information if you've already given it permission,=
=20
or if you have used it multiple times without turning off personalization.=
=20
Okay. Then the second sentence says they're required to delete that=20
information if you ask.=20
So, I suppose that means *if you didn't turn off personalization when the=
=20
notification showed up the first time, *turning off personalization is NOT=
=20
deleting the information which has already been given out. Deletion only=20
happens when the site/app is* expressly* asked to delete your personal=20
information. It seems you do this through Facebook, but how is anyone's=20
guess.
