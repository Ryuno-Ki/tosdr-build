They get (limited, it seems) access to Facebook's user information in order 
to see if any of their users are also on Facebook. They can't use your fb 
user id until you visit their site (which begs the question: how do they 
know you've visited their site assuming you don't have an account or 
haven't logged on?)

In addition to public info, it can see your user id, friends list (and any 
info *they* have made public). *Unless given your express permission, the 
site/app cannot see any information you haven't made public*. 

But, y'know. You may have given that permission in *their *ToS. ;")
