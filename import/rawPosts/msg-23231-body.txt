This Agreement does not transfer from PushBullet to you any PushBullet or
third party intellectual property, and all right, title and interest in and
to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with
PushBullet. PushBullet, PushBullet.com, the PushBullet.com logo, and all
other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with

this Agreement shall be finally settled in accordance with the
Comprehensive Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation

construed to reflect the parties' original intent, and the remaining
portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of
any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one
instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach
thereof. You may assign your rights under this Agreement to any party that
