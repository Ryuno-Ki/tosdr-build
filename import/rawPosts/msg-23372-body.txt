AND "AS AVAILABLE." COMPANY, ITS AGENTS, AND ITS LICENSORS DO NOT WARRANT
IN ANY WAY THE AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, CURRENTNESS,
SUITABILITY, RELIABILITY, TITLE, USEFULNESS, NONINFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF THE WEBSITES OR ANY
CONTENT OR INFORMATION AVAILABLE THROUGH THE WEBSITES. YOU ACCESS SUCH

IMPLIED WARRANTIES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH
STATES, THE LIABILITY OF COMPANY, AND ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS AND LICENSORS
IS LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY SUCH STATE LAW.
8. Governing Law. This Agreement is governed by and construed under the
laws of the State of Louisiana, without regard to its conflict of laws
principles. The federal courts within the state of Louisiana and state
courts of Ouachita Parish, Louisiana, have exclusive jurisdiction over and
venue of any suit that relates to this Agreement. You are responsible for
ensuring that your conduct is at all times in compliance with all

MAY USE IN CONNECTION WITH A WEBSITE. THE REQUIREMENT TO ARBITRATE APPLIES
EVEN IF A CLAIM ARISES AFTER WEBSITES ARE TERMINATED; APPLIES TO ALL CLAIMS
YOU MAY BRING AGAINST COMPANY EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AFFILIATES OR OTHER
REPRESENTATIVES; AND APPLIES TO ALL CLAIMS THAT COMPANY MAY BRING AGAINST
YOU. THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, NOT STATE LAW, APPLIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
AND ITS PROVISIONS AND, GOVERNS ALL QUESTIONS OF WHETHER A CLAIM IS SUBJECT
TO ARBITRATION.
A single arbitrator engaged in the practice of law will conduct the
arbitration. The arbitration will be filed with and the arbitrator will be
selected according to the rules of the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution
("CPR") and 9 U.S.C. Sec. 1, et. seq. We agree to act in good faith in
selecting an arbitrator. Except as expressly provided in the preceding
paragraph, the arbitration will be conducted by and under the
then-applicable rules of CPR and United States Code, wherever the
arbitration is filed or, if the arbitrator is chosen by mutual agreement of
the parties, the then-applicable rules of CPR will apply unless the parties
agree otherwise. All expedited procedures prescribed by the applicable
rules will apply. We agree to pay our respective arbitration costs, except
as otherwise required by rules of CPR, as applicable, but the arbitrator
can apportion these costs as appropriate. The arbitrator's decision and
award is final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any
court with jurisdiction. IF FOR ANY REASON, THE ABOVE PROVISIONS ON
ARBITRATION ARE HELD UNENFORCEABLE OR ARE FOUND NOT TO APPLY TO A CLAIM,
YOU AND COMPANY AGREE TO WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY. If any party files a judicial
or administrative action asserting a claim that is subject to arbitration
and another party successfully stays such action or compels arbitration,
the party filing that action must pay the other party's costs and expenses
incurred in seeking such stay or compelling arbitration, including
attorneys' fees. Except as expressly provided above, if any portion of this
section is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the
section remains in full force and effect.
10. Waiver and Severability; Assignment. Failure by Company to insist upon
or enforce strict performance of any provision of this Agreement will not
be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Neither the course of
conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify any
provision of this Agreement. Company may assign its rights and duties under
these terms to any party at any time without notice to you. If any
provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, this
Agreement's unaffected provisions will remain in effect.
11. Privacy Policy. Company respects the privacy of visitors to our
Websites. Please review our Privacy Policy at www.centuryLink.com.
B. Bill Presentation and Payment Terms and Conditions
Company electronic bill presentment and payment services are an online
billing information and bill payment service that may be provided by
Company for certain products (the "Services"). The Services may not be
available in certain areas or for certain products and services. The
Services are subject to both the Website Terms and Conditions above and the
following Service-specific terms and conditions. Company may modify these
Service-specific terms and conditions at any time without notice to you.
Modifications will be deemed effective immediately upon posting of the
modified terms at www.centuryLink.com.
1. Presentation of Payment. The electronic bill is due and payable upon
presentation and is past due if unpaid after the date shown on page one of
the invoice, consistent with the overall terms and conditions or tariffs
governing your Company-provided products or services. Electronic payments
made at www.centuryLink.com are processed within 24 hours to the extent
possible. If your payment is not made within the time allowed by your
state's Public Utility Commission, to the extent applicable to your Company
service, Company may begin procedures to cancel all services. You will be
informed of such action if required by law.
2. Partial Payment. Partial payments are acceptable, however they are not
to be construed as acceptable payment arrangements that automatically
extend service beyond the normal disconnect date. But our acceptance of
late or partial payments (even those marked, "Paid in Full") and late
payment charges is not a waiver of our right to collect the full amount
due. If you are unable to pay a bill in full prior to the due date, please
call customer service at the number located on page 1 of your Company bill.
3. Limitation of Liability. In addition to the limitations of liability
described in the Agreement, Company has no liability if: (a) your financial
institution shows that your designated account has insufficient funds or
credit availability; (b) Company is prohibited by law or court order from
withdrawing payment from your account; (c) your account is closed or
frozen; (d) any part of the electronic funds transfer system is not working
properly; or (e) there are any delays or failures in performance or any
interruptions arising from any cause or circumstance beyond Company's
reasonable control. Accounts credited with a payment that is subsequently
returned for any reason by your financial institution, including but not
limited to insufficient funds, account closed or invalid account number,
are debited for the amount of the original payment and all applicable
returned check charges. Your account may also be temporarily suspended
immediately upon our receipt of the denial of payment or returned check and
until payment is made in a cash transaction, e.g., cash, cashier's check,
money order or with a valid credit card. Please call customer service at
the number located on page 1 of your Company bill as soon as you are aware
that this could be a problem.
4. Questions about Bill. If you have any questions about your bill, call
Company customer service center at the telephone number printed on your
Company bill. While the item(s) in question about your charges are being
investigated, you do not have to pay them. But the amount not in question
is still due and payable upon receipt of your bill. If you have a dispute
about a charge on your bill, contact customer service at the number located
on page 1 of your Company bill immediately upon receipt of your bill to
ensure your dispute is recorded prior to collection action that could occur
as a result of an unpaid balance.
5. Payment Methods. If you are eligible to receive the Services for your
products and services, you may pay your bill either by (a) paying online at
www.centuryLink.com using eChecking or your credit card, (b) enrolling in
automatic bill payment available online, (c) using the automated voice
response system by calling customer service, (d) arranging to
electronically pay your bill through a bill payment service provider such
as your bank or financial institution, (e) or by mailing Company a check.
If you do arrange for electronic payment through another company or
financial institution you will be subject to those companies' terms and
conditions and you agree that Company will not be responsible or liable for
any loss or damage caused or created by those companies. In the event that
any amount on a third party site does not match the same amount on
www.centuryLink.com or your printed bill, the www.centuryLink.com and the
paper bill amount (the two being the same) will be deemed to be the
accurate amount. In the event the paper bill and the amount listed on your
online bill at www.centuryLink.com do not agree, the paper bill should be
considered the correct bill and should be used to determine the amount to
be paid. You may elect to have Company retain your payment information,
including but not limited to your billing name, address, telephone number,
credit card/debit card/account numbers, expiration dates, for you
convenience and use in future transactions authorized by you. You are
responsible for adding, updating, maintaining, deleting and verifying the
accuracy of any payment information that you ask Company to store for you.
You agree that Company will not be responsible for any transactions
rejected due to erroneous or outdated payment information. You also agree
that Company will not be liable for any use, misuse, lost, stolen or
incorrect payment information.
6. Bill Messages. Company may include messages developed by Company or as
required by state and federal authorities in the body of the bill. It is
your responsibility to view the entire bill.
7. Options to Receive Your Bill. Company may offer the option to receive
your bill either via US postal service or via email. If you elect the
option to receive your bill via email, you authorize Company to stop
sending you paper bills via mail and understand that you may receive one
more paper bill depending on your billing cycle. Please note that you will
have the option to print a paper copy on your home computer or save it to a
file. Each month, you will receive an email notification when your new bill
is available and understand that if, for any reason, you are unable to view
your bill online, you are still required to make your payment on time.
Also, under these circumstances, you are responsible for obtaining a bill
copy and/or account balance by calling the Company customer service at
1-877-290-5458. You also agree to provide Company with your email address
for the receipt of eBill notices and agree to keep your email address
updated and understand that it is your responsibility to log in and view
your bill each month, even if you do not receive an eBill notice for any
reason. Company will notify you via postal mail that your address needs to
be updated if it receives a message that your email bill notification is
undeliverable. However, if your email bill notification is undeliverable
for three consecutive months, then Company will re-activate your paper
bill. You understand that any late payment notices will still be sent
through the U.S. postal mail and you agree to pay your bill using one of
these approved methods (since sending paper checks without the remittance
stub may delay payment posting): Automatic Payments, Company online
payments or online payments from your financial institution or bill payment
service provider.
8. Fees. There are no additional fees charged by Company for using the
Services. But if you pay your bill electronically through a financial
institution, you are responsible for any charges you may incur from the
financial institution in order to make online payments.
9. Security. 128-bit encryption versions of Netscape or Internet Explorer
are required to use the Services. Please visit the Microsoft or Netscape
websites to get more details on 128-bit encryption. There are other
computer requirements necessary to view and pay your bill online, which are
listed on the Website. You are responsible for obtaining the necessary
encryption software. Company is not liable to you for any failure or
inability to obtain necessary encryption software.
10. Password. You agree that the password you use to access an account
through a Website will be kept confidential. If you forget your password,
you may reset your password online. You understand that you have sole
responsibility for the security of your password. You are solely
responsible for notifying us of the loss or theft of a password. We will
not be liable for any actions, claims, costs, damages, or expenses arising
from a lost or stolen password.
11. Termination of Services by Company. Company reserves the right to
terminate the Service or access to any account(s) enrolled in the Services
at any time.

A single arbitrator engaged in the practice of law will conduct the 
arbitration. The arbitration will be filed with and the arbitrator will 
be selected according to the rules of the CPR Institute for Dispute 
Resolution (&quot;CPR&quot;) and 9 U.S.C. Sec. 1, et. seq. We agree to act in good
 faith in selecting an arbitrator. Except as expressly provided in the

arbitration is filed or, if the arbitrator is chosen by mutual agreement
 of the parties, the then-applicable rules of CPR will apply unless the 
parties agree otherwise. All expedited procedures prescribed by the 
applicable rules will apply. We agree to pay our respective arbitration 
costs, except as otherwise required by rules of CPR, as applicable, but 
the arbitrator can apportion these costs as appropriate. The 
arbitrator&#39;s decision and award is final and binding, and judgment on 
the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction. IF FOR ANY 
REASON, THE ABOVE PROVISIONS ON ARBITRATION ARE HELD UNENFORCEABLE OR 
ARE FOUND NOT TO APPLY TO A CLAIM, YOU AND COMPANY AGREE TO WAIVE TRIAL 
BY JURY. If any party files a judicial or administrative action 
asserting a claim that is subject to arbitration and another party 
successfully stays such action or compels arbitration, the party filing 
that action must pay the other party&#39;s costs and expenses incurred in 
seeking such stay or compelling arbitration, including attorneys&#39; fees. 
Except as expressly provided above, if any portion of this section is 
determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the section 
remains in full force and effect.<br>
10. Waiver and Severability; Assignment. Failure by Company to insist 
upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of this Agreement 
will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Neither the

available in certain areas or for certain products and services. The 
Services are subject to both the Website Terms and Conditions above and 
the following Service-specific terms and conditions. Company may modify 
these Service-specific terms and conditions at any time without notice 
to you. Modifications will be deemed effective immediately upon posting

presentation and is past due if unpaid after the date shown on page one 
of the invoice, consistent with the overall terms and conditions or 
tariffs governing your Company-provided products or services. Electronic
 payments made at <a href="http://www.centuryLink.com">www.centuryLink.com</a> are processed within 24 hours to 
the extent possible. If your payment is not made within the time allowed
 by your state&#39;s Public Utility Commission, to the extent applicable to 
your Company service, Company may begin procedures to cancel all 
services. You will be informed of such action if required by law.<br>
2. Partial Payment. Partial payments are acceptable, however they are 
not to be construed as acceptable payment arrangements that 
automatically extend service beyond the normal disconnect date. But our 
acceptance of late or partial payments (even those marked, &quot;Paid in 
Full&quot;) and late payment charges is not a waiver of our right to collect 
the full amount due. If you are unable to pay a bill in full prior to 
the due date, please call customer service at the number located on page
 1 of your Company bill.<br>
3. Limitation of Liability. In addition to the limitations of liability

insufficient funds or credit availability; (b) Company is prohibited by 
law or court order from withdrawing payment from your account; (c) your 
account is closed or frozen; (d) any part of the electronic funds 
transfer system is not working properly; or (e) there are any delays or 
failures in performance or any interruptions arising from any cause or 
circumstance beyond Company&#39;s reasonable control. Accounts credited with
 a payment that is subsequently returned for any reason by your 
financial institution, including but not limited to insufficient funds, 
account closed or invalid account number, are debited for the amount of 
the original payment and all applicable returned check charges. Your 
account may also be temporarily suspended immediately upon our receipt 
of the denial of payment or returned check and until payment is made in a
 cash transaction, e.g., cash, cashier&#39;s check, money order or with a 
valid credit card. Please call customer service at the number located on
 page 1 of your Company bill as soon as you are aware that this could be
 a problem.<br>

 Company customer service center at the telephone number printed on your
 Company bill. While the item(s) in question about your charges are 
being investigated, you do not have to pay them. But the amount not in 
question is still due and payable upon receipt of your bill. If you have
 a dispute about a charge on your bill, contact customer service at the 
number located on page 1 of your Company bill immediately upon receipt 
of your bill to ensure your dispute is recorded prior to collection 
action that could occur as a result of an unpaid balance.<br>

online at <a href="http://www.centuryLink.com">www.centuryLink.com</a> using eChecking or your credit card, (b) 
enrolling in automatic bill payment available online, (c) using the 
automated voice response system by calling customer service, (d) 
arranging to electronically pay your bill through a bill payment service

companies. In the event that any amount on a third party site does not

<a href="http://www.centuryLink.com">www.centuryLink.com</a> and the paper bill amount (the two being the same) 
will be deemed to be the accurate amount. In the event the paper bill 
and the amount listed on your online bill at <a href="http://www.centuryLink.com">www.centuryLink.com</a> do not 
agree, the paper bill should be considered the correct bill and should 
be used to determine the amount to be paid. You may elect to have 
Company retain your payment information, including but not limited to 
your billing name, address, telephone number, credit card/debit 
card/account numbers, expiration dates, for you convenience and use in 
future transactions authorized by you. You are responsible for adding, 
updating, maintaining, deleting and verifying the accuracy of any 
payment information that you ask Company to store for you. You agree
