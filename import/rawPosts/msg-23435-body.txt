by going to any mega.com url, you agree to these TOS

mega provides notice for Tos changes

you are responsible for any breaches of the TOS, including breaches by the people who download your file

you are bound to keep backups, so mega is not responsible for data loss

mega can de-duplicate your files(delete exact copies and give you access to the original)

mega reserves the right to suspend, terminate, and/or delete your account/data due to a TOS breach

notice is required if mega changes thier fees

if a payment is overdue, mega will charge an additional 10% yearly interest on top of the existing payment(calculated on a daily basis) until the entire fees are paid, and/or suspend or terminate your account.

you own your uploads, and mega can only give your data to the people you give the link to

illegal files are a violation of the TOS

mega reserves the right to remove data without notice if it infringes copyright

Mega will not provide refunds due to early termination

mega will suspend or terminate you account at any time without notice if you breach the TOS, and if you aren't a registered user, mega can suspend or terminate your access to their site without notice. 

mega reserves the right to remove any communication (forum post, chat message) at any time without notice

mega is not responsible for corruption or loss of data while using their website

mega will disclose data if required by law

Privacy Policy:

mega will not sell your personal data

mega does do basic analytics

mega will abide to all unsubscription requests(e-mail)

you can request access to all the information mega has on you, at a fee charged within legal proportions.

the terms are governed by new Zealand law (why?)
