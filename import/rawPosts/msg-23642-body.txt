I dont see a problem if an alternate legal remedy is provided in the clause=
, they are not absolutely waiving your right to legal action but are just n=
avigating through other mechanisms to provide legal redressal which actuall=
y is appreciated to be a more efficient-cost wise,time wise method of deliv=
ering justice. Even the courts have discouraged litigation when alternate r=
emedies exist.
