Hi Jesse,

That's great. In the future, it should be easy to contribute new
URL, as Jimms is developing a web user interface for tosback3.
Meanwhile, I suggest you go to https://github.com/tosdr/tosback3
all technical details should be there for you to make a pull
request.

(Also, if you have some questions, Jimm has documented some of the
work in blog posts at http://jimmstout.com)

Thanks!
