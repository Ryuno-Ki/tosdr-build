If you have no terms, it means what the law provisions by default
will apply (which ever law has to apply in whichever context).

If there are no terms, we have nothing to analyse and nothing to
rate. So there would be no ranking, but I guess it's useful to
make a specific case of services which have no terms. So the
ranking would probably be: "No Terms"

Best,
Hugo
