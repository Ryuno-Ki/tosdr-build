Generally the TOS are good. Mostly CYA, with two less consumer friendly
sections:

"KIXEYE reserves the right to charge for any portion of the Service and to
change its fees or subscription rates (if any) from time to time in its
discretion. You are responsible for all charges incurred on any payment
method associated with Your account. You agree to pay all fees when due."

"YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT KIXEYE IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY
REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE CASH OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED
VIRTUAL CURRENCY WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS
VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY."
