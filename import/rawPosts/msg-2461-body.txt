[Note: This was previously discussed at https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tos=
dr/DBigzl5jYqU/v997q9E9XaUJ ]

Google's terms say http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/ :

    When you upload or otherwise submit content to our Services,
    you give Google (and those we work with) a worldwide license
    to [=E2=80=A6] such content ...
   =20
=E2=86=91 This is the copyright license (to learn more about it, just see:
https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tosdr/lU-QhFXMOcU/discussion )

   =20
    ... The rights you grant in this license are for the limited
    purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services,
    and to develop new ones.

=E2=86=91 This is a well known principle: =E2=80=9Cpurpose limitation=E2=80=
=9D for data
(see
https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tosdr/lU-QhFXMOcU/k5kxA_OAyPAJ )
The aim of such limitation is to make sure the data you provide
will be used for what the users want, not for something else.

But the problem is that the license is granted for all Google
services, including "new" services, i.e. services that do not
exist yet at the time the user signs up.

These different services are not clearly identified. Google has a
lot of services that the user might not be aware of, or might not
want to use.

This is very clear in the case of services which do not exist yet.
By definition, the user cannot know about them. So that means your
data could be used in the future for something completely
different!

To some people, that might ring a bell:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Buzz#Privacy
Let me quote the wikipedia article:

     In the announcement, the FTC agreed with the EPIC complaint
     that Google had violated its privacy policies by using
     information provided for Gmail for another purpose - social
     networking - without obtaining consumers=E2=80=99 permission in
     advance.=20

There you have it. With the new privacy policy, it looks like the
same mistake that caused major privacy implications would now be
allowed, because supposedly the user has give his/her consent (by
agreeing the content may be used for all services and for future
services as well). Google would NOT have to ask for your consent
again in the future. So you're giving =E2=80=9Ccarte blanche=E2=80=9D to Go=
ogle in
a way.

We think it's not appropriate.

Best,
Hugo
