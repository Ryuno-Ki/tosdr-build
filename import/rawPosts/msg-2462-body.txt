That's understandable. It seems that what you suggest is something
along the lines of "substantial changes" because quite frankly I
don't think any company would be okay saying outloud publicly that
the next changes they will bring to their Terms are negative for
the users.

However, nowhere does Google make it an obligation of their own to
actively notify emails of major changes (they only say they will
post a notice on the ToS page, or in some instances directly in
the specific service, which seems fine but could be improved
IMHO).

I think this is not perfect, especially because 14 days doesn't
seem that much:

> But I do consider 14 days and "not retroactively" to be generous, especially when paired with Google Takeout (so you can leave Google at a moments notice, taking all your data from all services with you).

Soundcloud  gives 6 weeks, Rapidshare 4. For such a major operator
as Google, 2 weeks seems a bit light.

Best,
Hugo
