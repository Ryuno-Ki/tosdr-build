Let's have a look at the global scale on "Changing the terms". It
ranges from "we can change any time, without notifying you" to "we
notify you by email and give you 6 weeks to make up your mind".

So Google's current clause on how they change terms seem fairly on
the green side to me. Although I agree it could be improved, but
again right now it's 25/100 wich seems consistant with everything
else. But it's true that we could adjust it a little bit. Let's do
this when we have more points :-)
