9 months and 18 months is not quite the right framing. Those are dates
for "anonymizing", which has repeatedly been shown to be ineffectual, as
"de-anonymizing" search history is fairly easy to do.

Plus, those durations are from the time that you *stop* using the
service, not from when you enter the search query. Here's a money quote
from EFF:
----
Note that disabling Web History in your Google account will not prevent
Google from gathering and storing this information and using it for
internal purposes. It also does not change the fact that any information
gathered and stored by Google could be sought by law enforcement.

With Web History enabled, Google will keep these records indefinitely;
with it disabled, they will be partially anonymized after 18 months, and
certain kinds of uses, including sending you customized search results,
will be prevented. If you want to do more to reduce the records Google
keeps, the advice in EFF's Six Tips to Protect Your Search Privacy white
paper remains relevant.
----

-googles-new-privacy-policy-takes-effect

I spent the last 15 minutes trying to find the definitive statement in
Google's official policy documents. I believe I have tracked it down
before, but I didn't have any luck today. It's my opinion that this is
intentionally obfuscated so people won't realize the extent to which
they have lost control over their search data.
