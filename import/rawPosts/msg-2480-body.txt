Google's copyright license may be limited for purpose, it is not
limited in time in general:

    http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
   =20
    When you upload or otherwise submit content to our Services,
    you give Google (and those we work with) a worldwide license
    to [=85] such content. This license continues even if you stop
    using our Services (for example, for a business listing you
    have added to Google Maps). Some Services may offer you ways
    to access and remove content that has been provided to that
    Service. Also, in some of our Services, there are terms or
    settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content
    submitted in those Services. [=85]

For some services, as indicated, it might makes sense. But I doubt
that it really makes sense for all services. The fact that by
default Google's keeping the right to use your content even if you
stop using the service is a source of worries, especially wince
content can be used by other Google services you might not be
aware of.

I suppose the other way around would be more fair towards the
user.


So, how should we sum up this? I propose:

    Google keeps the rights on your content when you stop using it

    The license that you grant to Google on content you upload to
    their services will continue even if you stop using the
    services. While this makes sense for some services (e.g.
    Google Maps) this applies by default to all Google services.
    Otherwise you need to check each service for ways to remove
    content and for specific clauses that restrict the license in
    time.
