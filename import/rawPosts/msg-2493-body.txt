    Modifying and Terminating our Services

    We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may
    add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend
    or stop a Service altogether.

    You can stop using our Services at any time, although we=92ll be
    sorry to see you go. Google may also stop providing Services to
    you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.

    We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to
    such data is important. If we discontinue a Service, where
    reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice
    and a chance to get information out of that Service.=20

So we have to distinguish two cases:

 - Google stops a service to all users
 - Google stops a service to you

In the first case, everything looks okay. Google can stop
services, they have no obligation to continue providing a service.
Thumbs up: they give you reasonable advance notice when they
discontinue a service, so that you can get your things out. (For
instance, recently Google Reader was discontinued that way).
However, to what extent it applies to your data is difficult to
say, as the clause refers to "information" (but it's true that it
states at the beginning "your own data"=85)

For the second case, search for the other topic ;)
