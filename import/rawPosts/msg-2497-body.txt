    Modifying and Terminating our Services

    We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may
    add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend
    or stop a Service altogether.

    You can stop using our Services at any time, although we=92ll be
    sorry to see you go. Google may also stop providing Services to
    you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.

    We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to
    such data is important. If we discontinue a Service, where
    reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice
    and a chance to get information out of that Service.=20

So we have to distinguish two cases:

 - Google stops a service to all users
    (Read: https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tosdr/PD5ZWzgv2RI/discussion )

 - Google stops a service to you

The "reasonable advance notice" only applies to the first case,
not the latter. So without further details from the terms, it's
fair to draw the conclusion that Google can stop providing a
service to you at any time, without giving you a reason or
anything. At least, they don't say that they can stop providing a
service "for no reason" or "for any reason" but to be completely
silent about it might not make things easy for the user.

This looks similar to Github and Netflix (but not exactly the
same)

  - https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tosdr/hI5Too_uDVk/discussion
  - https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tosdr/L5pl0Vn9lKY/discussion

So I propose to sum it up like this:

Google may stop providing services to you at any time

=93Google may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create
new limits to our Services at any time.=94 Google has no obligation
from the terms to give you notice in advance or to give a reason
for that termination.
