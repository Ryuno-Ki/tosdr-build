The privacy policy states under "Information we share"

    We do not share personal information with companies,
    organizations and individuals outside of Google unless one of
    the following circumstances apply:

        With your consent

            We will share personal information with companies,
            organizations or individuals outside of Google when we
            have your consent to do so. We require opt-in consent
            for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.

        [=85]

    We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable
    information publicly and with our partners =96 like publishers,
    advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share
    information publicly to show trends about the general use of
    our services.=20

This second bit should not be underestimated, as the terms is only
defined as =93This is information that is recorded about users so
that it no longer reflects or references an individually
identifiable user.=94 in http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/key=
-terms/#toc-terms-info

My real concern though is with the above. There is a contradiction
between the first statement and the first item on the list. Google
says they don't share personal info unless they get your consent,
but they make a distinction between:

 - Personal information

    defined as "This is information which you provide to us which
    personally identifies you, such as your name, email address or
    billing information, or other data which can be reasonably
    linked to such information by Google."

 - Sensitive personal information

    This is a particular category of personal information relating
    to confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins,
    political or religious beliefs or sexuality.=20

And they say that they require =93opt-in consent=94 for the sharing of
the latter, which seems to imply that for sharing usual personal
information with others, Google does not require =93opt-in consent=94.

I am curious to what consent that's not "opt-in consent" looks
like. In the context of a privacy policy like this one, since you
already consent to use Google's services and to upload some data
and to allow them to collect some data, it seems that by default
you consent to the sharing of non-sensitive personal information.

What do others think?

I propose to reduce our point to information that can be shared
without requiring subsequent "opt-in" consent and so to sum it up
like this:

    Google can share personal information and aggregated
    non-personal information with other parties

Google will share your personal information with other parties.
For sensitive information (medical, racial, ethnic, political,
religious or sexuality) Google requires =93opt-in=94. Google can also
share or publish aggregated data that does not identify a
person.
