Dear contributors,

The general terms of service of Google are not very long. It is
quite complex to rate them, as these ToS govern all google
services, but contradictory clauses may supersede them in specific
services.

All in all, if you add up all points to Google, you still reach a
negative result. Hence, Google will probably rank class C (defined
as  =93The terms of service are okay but some issues need your
consideration.=94 here http://tosdr.org/classification.html )

Interesting enough, some of our points are pointed out by data
protection authority as not compliant with the current European
regulation

-policy-incomplete-information-and-uncontrolled-combination-of-data-across-=
ser/

What do you think? Feel free to discuss all specific issues in
their dedicated email thread, and above all to submit new emails
regarding other points or other texts that we did not see!

Thank you all for the great work you all did on helping us shed
some light on these long terms.

Best,
Hugo
