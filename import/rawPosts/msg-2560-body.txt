This one's a bit complex.

I distinguish different things:

 - Grammarly modifies or stops providing a service or a feature
 - Grammarly suspends availability of data or content
 - Grammarly imposes new limits

In each case it may without notice, without liability.

Grammarly will use its =93commercially reasonable efforts=94 to notify
you of changes that in their =93reasonable opinion=94 materially or
adversely diminish functionality of the services.

So it's contradictory. But I've got to say it looks like it's not=20
very obligating to them.
