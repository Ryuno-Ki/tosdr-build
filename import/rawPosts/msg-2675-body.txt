I'm trying to work with the TOSback efforts, but I'm confused by the two
different versions (2 and 3) and some broken links to repositories:
https://github.com/JimmStout/tosback2/tree/master/rules (from
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/01/campus-party-hackathon-making-rule-contribution-tosback )

I'm also running primarily on an old Ubuntu (Lucid, 10.04) which makes
updating to Ruby 1.9.3 more challenging...

Jimm -- can you (or someone else) point me to where the most current
activity is?
