Objet=A0: The new "Who Has Your Back?" report is out!

Dear Friend of Digital Freedom,
I'm excited to announce the latest update to our annual "Who Has Your Back?=
" privacy report! [https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-2013?support_whyb=
=3D1]

When you use the Internet, companies ask you to trust them with your privat=
e data: from personal messages, to search terms, to photos, and much more. =
But government officials increasingly ask companies to hand that data over,=
 a fact highlighted by the recent battle over CISPA.

To make "Who Has Your Back?", EFF lawyers and activists review company poli=
cies and interview legal departments to find out exactly how companies deal=
 with government requests for your data. We review their answers and give s=
tars to companies with industry-leading policies and practices, which helps=
 privacy-conscious users make informed decisions and encourages the compani=
es to step it up.

But the real power behind "Who Has Your Back?" comes from you. EFF's strong=
 and principled community pushes companies to take privacy seriously, and a=
fter three years, we're proud to report that even more companies have moved=
 towards instituting best practices when it comes to standing up for users=
=92 privacy from the government.

We=92re proud to be fighting for users=92 rights, made possible by donation=
s from individuals like you. Please consider supporting projects like "Who =
Has Your Back?" by joining EFF today! [https://supporters/eff.org/donate/wh=
o-has-your-back]

Thank you,

Marcia Hoffman
