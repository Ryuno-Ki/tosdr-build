It's not just a bad point -- as I've said before when this point has come 
up on this list, courts repeatedly refuse to honor this kind of unilateral 
contract modification. If Grammarly is actually sending out email, that's 
fine, but if they're making a material change (like a change to billing) 
without notifying customers and expecting customers to simply keep track of 
changes to the terms of use, that fundamentally changes the agreement 
between the service and the customer without creating a new contract. 
Courts will strike that down.
