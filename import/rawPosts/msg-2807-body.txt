That seems rather balanced to me. They say they take reasonable data 
protection precautions; but it's right that 100% security does not exist, 
so they don't guarantee it. It would be a plus to guarantee security, but I 
also understand why a service wouldn't want to guarantee that. So I'd 
change that to neutral. What do you think?
