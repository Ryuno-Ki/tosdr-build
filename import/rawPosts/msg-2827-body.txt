=BBYou may cancel your Airbnb Account at any time via the =93Cancel
Account=94 feature of the Services or by sending an email to
terms@airbnb.com.=AB

Which is good. I=92d also say that the following is ok:

=BBPlease note that if your Airbnb Account is cancelled, we do not have
an obligation to delete or return to you any Content you have posted
to the Site, Application and Services, including, but not limited to,
any reviews or Feedback.=AB

Considering that it=92s public reviews of places and other users I=92d say
this is reasonable. I wonder though if your name will still show up
there, or if it will say something like =BB(deleted user)=AB similar to
reddit for instance.


(From https://www.airbnb.com/terms, section =BBTermination and Airbnb
Account Cancellation=AB)
