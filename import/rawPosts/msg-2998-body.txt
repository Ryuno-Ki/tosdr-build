 Youtube can remove an account without prior notice and in its sole
discretion.


  =AB YouTube will terminate a user's access to the Service if, under
appropriate circumstances, the user is determined to be a repeat
infringer. =BB


 =AB YouTube reserves the right to decide whether Content violates these
Terms of Service for reasons other than copyright infringement, such as,
but not limited to, pornography, obscenity, or excessive length. YouTube
may at any time, *without prior notice* and in *its sole discretion*,
remove such Content and/or terminate a user's account for submitting such
material in violation of these Terms of Service. =BB


Good point : if you are the target of a copyright holder's take-down
notice, youtube gives you a chance to defend your right. But the exclusive
competence of the jurisdiction of California is not that pertinent :


Counter-Notice. If you believe that your Content that was removed (or to
which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the
authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or
pursuant to the law, to post and use the material in your Content, you may
send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright
Agent:

Your physical or electronic signature;

Identification of the Content that has been removed or to which access has
been disabled and the location at which the Content appeared before it was
removed or disabled;

A statement that you have a good faith belief that the Content was removed
or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the Content;
and

Your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that
you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in *San Francisco,
California*, and a statement that you will accept service of process from
the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.

If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, YouTube may send a
copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that
person that it may replace the removed Content or cease disabling it in 10
business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court
order against the Content provider, member or user, the removed Content may
be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more
after receipt of the counter-notice, at YouTube's sole discretion.
