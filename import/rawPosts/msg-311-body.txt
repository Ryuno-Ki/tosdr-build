"You may not use the Service and you may not accept this Agreement if 
you are not of a legal age to form a binding contract with Intuit."

interesting that they relate it to forming a binding contract, i wonder 
how other sites see that if users between 13 and 18 years old tick the 
box to say they have read the terms of service. are terms of service not 
binding if the user is a minor? if so, then does that mean users under 
18 have no obligations? and does it then mean they also have no rights?

noting down this data point mainly for reference.
