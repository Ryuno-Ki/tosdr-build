Hugo,

Since we seem to be focused quite sharply on US copyright law, let me addre=
ss "fair use"=20
under that body of law. What might seem to one "obviously" fair use might n=
ot to=20
another.  The rules are quite vague for this defense to infringement-even c=
ourts=20
sometimes disagree in the same case.  It is a bit outside the range of a da=
ta storage=20
company to adjudicate such claims. =20

As it is beyond such a company=B4s skill set to adjudicate whether a person=
 actually has a=20
copyright ownership in something, or whether someother work is "derivative"=
 and thus=20
belongs to the person from whose work it is derived. =20

All those are grist for a US district court, as the Congress has decided.

I agree that someone like Dropbox should advise the target of a takedown th=
at there is a=20
counter-notice available, and which law it falls under.  But they should no=
t in my=20
judgment take sides.  Both sides may and often will be "their users."  And =
they are not=20
competent to decide these complex questions of mixed fact and law.  Their s=
kills are in=20
maintaining a network and a data store.

As for a rule that a user who suffers n number of undisputed take downs sho=
uld be=20
suspended, that should be up to the host, in this case Dropbox. =20

I do not agree with some who claim in essence there should not be a copyrig=
ht law=20
because it has a chilling effect and/or violates the First Amendment.  The =
US=20
Constitution requires Congress enact some form of copyright law.  If the Fi=
rst=20
Amendment were intended in its free speech clause to undo that, I think the=
 writers of=20
that Amendment would have said so explicitly.  There is some chilling inten=
ded.

My two cents.

Phil Marcus
