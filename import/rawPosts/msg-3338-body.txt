"We may at any time decide to end the entire virtual currency and Items 
program for all or any of our Jagex Products. Before we delete the unused 
virtual currency, we will endeavour to give you at least four weeks to 
redeem it."

But, also since it's connected to your account, this applies:

"If, acting reasonably, we consider that:

   1. our Terms and Conditions have or may have been breached;
   2. there has been fraudulent, unlawful or abusive activity; or
   3. it is necessary in order to prevent or stop any harm or damage to us, 
   to any Jagex Product, to other players or the general public, we may at any 
   time: (i) Stop (as defined above) any or all accounts for Jagex Products; 
   (ii) restrict access to any content-uploading or other feature of our 
   service; and/or (iii) restrict access to or delete virtual currency or 
   anything acquired by means of virtual currency. These actions may result in 
   loss of real money paid in prohibited transactions, such as account 
   trading. If we take any of the above action, you may have a right of appeal.

We do not guarantee the ongoing supply of any Jagex Product. Upon 
reasonable notice to you, Jagex may deactivate any account and you 
acknowledge and agree that you are not entitled to any refund for any 
amounts paid in connection with the account."
