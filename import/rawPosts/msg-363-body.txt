"We can change these terms at any time and we will provide you notice 
of the change, whether via our website, by sending you an email or via 
any messaging service we provide. Your continued use after that notice 
means that you agree to the changed terms."
https://github.com/tosdr/tosback2/blob/265e49bf24a91076495ce1fddf279c4638421a66/crawl/mega.co.nz/Terms%20of%20Service.txt#L15

hopefully they will send an email if the changes are significant, but 
this clause doesn't oblige them to do that, they could make changes with 
immediate effect and only update the website silently.

also, their website is highly javascript-based, so the pages we crawl 
with tosback2 are internal ajax URLs (see 
https://github.com/tosdr/tosback2/blob/265e49bf24a91076495ce1fddf279c4638421a66/rules/mega.co.nz.xml), 
not the URLs on which the user actually views the terms and pp.

Any site could change the link on their home page so that the 'terms' 
link points to /terms_new.html instead of /terms.html and we wouldn't 
notice,
but in this case, because the URLs we track are ajax URLs, it is 
particularly hard to detect whether they updated their terms.

this means that basically they can do whatever they want just by 
silently and unilaterally changing their terms when they feel like it, 
and unless somebody accidentally discovers it, all active users would be 
bound to the new terms instantly.
