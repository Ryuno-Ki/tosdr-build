"If you allow others to access your data (e.g. by, amongst other 
things, giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in 
addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their 
actions and omissions while they are using the website and services and 
you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs 
(including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of 
these terms."
https://github.com/tosdr/tosback2/blob/265e49bf24a91076495ce1fddf279c4638421a66/crawl/mega.co.nz/Terms%20of%20Service.txt#L25

i guess this odd clause is there because they expect that many users 
will use the service for sharing copyrighted material, and they don't 
want to get into trouble for that. For instance, user 1 could upload a 
copyrighted file, and then user 2 publishes a link to it on a searchable 
forum. Through this clause, user 1 would be responsible for the behavior 
of user 2, and moreover, if the copyright owner decides to sue Mega 
(which they shouldn't, they should probably only sue user 2 and send a 
removal request to the forum), then user 1 has to pay for the legal fees 
of Mega.

this means that through no fault of their own, user 1 could suddenly 
have to pay a lot of money to Mega.

You may hope that this clause never comes into effect, but that is only 
hope. the truth is that as a Mega user you are agreeing that you may 
have to pay a lot of money to Mega, even if you were not the person who 
got them into trouble.

what do other people think of this? i think this clause is really quite 
heavy, and goes a lot further than the more standard 'you will indemnify 
us if you broke these terms' clause that many other services have.
