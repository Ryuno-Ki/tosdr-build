"our end-to-end encryption model inherently precludes any server-side 
manipulation of your data"
https://mega.co.nz/#help

"Our service includes UCE. You should keep your encryption keys safe 
and confidential and not release them to anyone unless you wish them to 
have access to your data. If you lose or misplace your encryption keys, 
you will lose access to your data. We strongly urge you to use robust 
anti-virus and firewall protection."
https://github.com/tosdr/tosback2/blob/265e49bf24a91076495ce1fddf279c4638421a66/crawl/mega.co.nz/Terms%20of%20Service.txt#L29

there is no guarantee that Mega.co.nz cannot access your files, but at 
least their business model is based on *not* being able to access your 
data, which is quite refreshing after so many web 2.0 companies who 
based their business model on making your data its product.
