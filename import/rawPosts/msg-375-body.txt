see also:
"DESPITE THE ABOVE, IF ANY COURT HOLDS US (THIS INCLUDES OUR OFFICERS, 
STAFF AND AGENTS) LIABLE FOR ANY MATTER RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR 
SERVICES, OUR TOTAL COMBINED LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE SUM OF 
YOUR MONTHLY FEES PAID BY YOU FOR THE PREVIOUS MONTH"
https://github.com/tosdr/tosback2/blob/265e49bf24a91076495ce1fddf279c4638421a66/crawl/mega.co.nz/Terms%20of%20Service.txt#L302

which is again in one direction only. the contract should apply that 
clause in both directions, if at all.
