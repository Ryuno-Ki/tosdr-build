Without much details on how the anonymisation process is handled,
I don't really see what we can do with that.

As far as statements like "what's yours stays yours" go, I do not
feel convinced we can take them into account. What matters are the
copyright license and the ways they handle personal data.

In the past, I just ignored them.
