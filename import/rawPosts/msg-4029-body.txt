It does make sense sometimes. For instance, a service that
collects a lot of personal data and where the ToS are silent about
what do they with them and how long they keep them; we would
definitely raise a flag about it.

For business m&a I'm not sure we need to do it. But yes, that's
the idea, if you think for one service it's needed, it makes sense
to suggest a point.

Hence my answer, "it depends." :)

We're here to discuss them one by one, so we can think on specific
facts before we can reach a general conclusion.
