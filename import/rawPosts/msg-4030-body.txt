For my iPhone, I can control which apps use geolocation or not, as these 
screenshots provided by Amazon show (although I don't have the Amazon app, 
nor do I want it, actually). Are you suggesting that they by-pass that 
entirely and my phone would send them data anyway?

For example, I have the Facebook app, but don't have location services on 
for it because it's none of their business.

<br>If you follow their advice, they show you how to turn of location
