From the Netflix ToS;
https://signup.netflix.com/TermsOfUse#changes

    Netflix reserves the right, from time to time, with or without
    notice to you, to change these Terms of Use, including the
    Privacy Policy and EULA, in our sole and absolute discretion.
    The most current version of these Terms of Use can be reviewed
    by visiting our website and clicking on "Terms of Use" located
    at the bottom of the pages of the Netflix website. The most
    current version of the Terms of Use will supersede all
    previous versions. We will endeavor to post prior version(s)
    on our website when the Terms of Use are updated. You can see
    changes from previous versions of the Terms of Use that we
    have posted by visiting our website and clicking here.

So they can still change the ToS at any time even without
notifying the user. (True that they have archived versions).
