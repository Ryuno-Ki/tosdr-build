For what it's worth, binding arbitration and class action waivers are=20
something Hugo and I have recently been discussing at some length over in=
=20
the Sony Entertainment thread<https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=
=3D#!msg/tosdr/di_y5K5pzZw/4OEqTmUteFEJ>.=20
As I said there, since the Supreme Court's decision in 2010, these are=20
becoming standard. That doesn't mean they're *good*, it just means they're=
=20
standard.

In general, they do reduce consumers' rights. On the plus side, arbitration=
=20
is usually much faster, more convenient, and less expensive than going to=
=20
court, so it can be a better option for both parties in smaller disputes=20
(which most consumer disputes are). In fact, they can actually be more=20
beneficial to the consumer than to the corporation: it may be too expensive=
=20
for a consumer to bring a smaller dispute (less than around $10,000) to=20
court, and an unscrupulous large entity can drive up court costs to force a=
=20
weaker party to drop a legitimate suit. However, if both parties are bound=
=20
to arbitration, it may be easier for a consumer to bring a small dispute=20
against a large entity. Arbitration agreements *can* be written to be=20
consumer-friendly.

It's class action waivers that I have a bigger problem with, and I discuss=
=20
those in more detail over in the other thread.
