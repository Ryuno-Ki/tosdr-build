I think the legal culture in the US in relation to money is so
different than Europe that it would be difficult to assess this
kind of things.

OTOH it's true that most terms set jurisdiction clauses in the US
anyway.

But still, it seems to me that binding arbitration isn't
appropriate for consumers in most cases; it's fine as an option.
