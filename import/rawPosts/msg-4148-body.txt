I'd like more information about what they do exactly before giving
good points for such a blank statement.

Saying something like that does not hold much water, it's a bit
like when we read things similar to:

"what's yours stay yours, we're not in the business of taking away
what's yours=20

=85

You grant us a non-exclusive, royalty free, irrevocable,
transferable, sublicensable, license to use, display, transform,
on any media to your content."

So unless there really isn't anything related to Amazon making
things from their customers' information; i'd say we should
dismiss this.
