They can change the terms *at their discretion*, but they will notify the 
user in *reasonable advance* by email *or* by posting them online. Your *use
* of the service *constitutes acceptance* of the changes in the terms.

An exception can be made in case of changes due to administrative or legal 
reasons which do not constitute material change according to the service 
provider. However, there are still problems with these clauses. First, the 
notice lacks certainty (how much is "reasonable"?) and form (it can be 
either by email or by posting them online; so it might not be sufficient). 
Second, your use of the service constitutes acceptance of the changes. This 
is actually not the best option, because it means material changes 
detrimental to the users can be silently accepted by them. It is better to 
have explicit consent again when the changes are a regression.

This applies to these services:

>    We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of 
>    Use (*"Updated Terms"*) from time to time. Unless we make a change for 
>    legal or administrative reasons, we will provide reasonable advance notice 
>    before the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may notify you 
>    of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of 
>    the Service after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in 
>    such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement 
>    to the Updated Terms.
>    
   
Please  post here about services which have identical clauses.
