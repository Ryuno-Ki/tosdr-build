Providing refunds is a normal aspect of the selling business. Are
there specific terms about refunds that we should raise?=20

Otherwise, I don't see it as relevant to mention something like:
=93Amazon provides refunds=94 (I would be surprised if they did not).
I don't know about that in the US, but in Europe a consumer can
return a good and get a refund under a certain period of time (2
weeks?)
