i guess it's a way to try to stop you from copying their intellectual 
property.

I just watched 'The Social Network' again yesterday, which has an 
interesting case of this with the Winklevii. I love the phrase in there 
"If Facebook was your invention, then you would have built Facebook". :)

Hugo, what is your stance on reverse-engineering by itself? (so 
strictly looking at how something works, without necessarily publishing 
a competing product based on what you learned from it).
