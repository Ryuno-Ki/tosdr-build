Subject: Differences between the services/*.json files and the
 tosback2/rules/*.xml files

Here's a list of the differences between the entries in the tosback2
files and in the tosdr/services files. First is listed the sites with
different URLs (the tosdr ones are listed first). Next is a list of the
sites that are only in the tosdr files, and not in tosback2 at all. I
didn't list the reverse, as there are hundreds of those. ;-) Finally is
a list of the 5 sites that are in sync, out of the total of 23 sites in
the tosdr list that have URLs listed.
