I don't see how all of this makes it so much easier, when looking at work i=
nvolved and new problems/bottlenecks. Also, you're asking for someone to bu=
ild a specific solution instead of getting feedback on the whole concept fi=
rst.

Here's what I would propose =E2=80=93 no server or SSH or manual work neede=
d, all transparent (and manageable by anyone, no credentials needed):

* Build a form for creating a new point
* Validate the input with a JSON schema you create for your JSON formats
* Show output JSON to copy to GitHub
* Link to the according create-a-new-file form on GitHub and say to paste t=
here and hit save (maybe this step needs more thinking about UX)
* User hits save on GitHub and automatically forks and creates a pull reque=
st with just one hit on the save button. No Git skills needed.

I thought about this for adding JSON data to an app I created for Hacker Be=
ach, and I think it would be possible to make this a convenient workflow. T=
he best thing: You can discuss everything in the pull request, make line co=
mments, have notifications, etc. It's so much better than having it uncateg=
orized in a mailing list and detached from the actual content that's going =
to be merged. Also, everyone else can fork a proposed change and improve an=
d make another PR, if needed. And the reviewer has everything in one place.

If this sounds remotely possible or interesting, you should probably consid=
er rethinking your concept before implementing something that may be even m=
ore complicated instead of easier than now.

Cheers,
Basti
