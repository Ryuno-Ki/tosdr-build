Incidentally, Apple's ToS (at least last time I checked) were very subtly d=
ifferent from the usual 'we can change our ToS any time we want' clause.

They claim the ability to change their ToS for future usage and purchases. =
However, for any purchases of any kind (music, apps, whatever) that have al=
ready been made, the user has the option of using the old terms that it was=
 purchased under or the new terms, whichever they prefer. Which, of course,=
 includes the clause that allows you to use the old terms instead of the ne=
w ones.

So, at the very least, Apple in theory cannot (e.g.) change the terms under=
 which you can use, copy, or transfer the music you have bought from them a=
lready. I have not read the Audible.com terms and conditions in several yea=
rs =97 and do not intend to go through that particular soul-grind again =97=
 but if I read them right the first time, they (and many others) reserve th=
e right to change the terms and conditions by which you can use content tha=
t you 'licensed from them' previously, at any time.
