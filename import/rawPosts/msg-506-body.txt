Hi,

>> * Build a form for creating a new point
>> * Validate the input with a JSON schema you create for your JSON formats
>> * Show output JSON to copy to GitHub

> Making the reviewer go to github just so that we don't have to implement =
a server is too much price in terms of usability for too little gain on our=
 side, i think. You don't see generic web 2.0 websites do this either, show=
ing a user a "now please manually paste this JSON into our database" messag=
e, for this same reason i think.

You ask them to log in via Persona first instead. I'd argue more people hav=
e GitHub accounts than Persona ones. Also, they *are* contributing to an op=
en-source project, so why hide all the work that actually ensues and let th=
em "submit" to a black box? For me e.g. it is much more user-friendly to be=
 able to see my submission, alter it, and follow it on Github, than just to=
 send it somewhere and wait.

> It would also require us to move the discussion to github. This was propo=
sed before, by Jan, when we thought many of the reviewers might be github u=
sers, but we decided against that, and create the Google Group instead. If =
we decide to move the discussion somewhere else, then we should do that for=
 functional reasons, not for technical ones. I think maybe at some point we=
 want to host the discussion on the website, so that we can add more custom=
 context to discussions, but for now, I think having it at Google Groups is=
 good enough?

So for the discussion, it's "good enough" and you don't see the hindrance o=
f having to log into Google and use a mailing list there, especially when c=
ompletely detached from the submission? How is it a better user experience =
to have an invisible server submit and then discuss that on the mailing lis=
t, being completely unable to see the changes along the way or make changes=
 and add to the PR? I *am* talking about functional reasons here.

And btw, you can also pull both the PRs and the discussions to the website =
via the API.

> Anyway, whether the JSON is saved to a file, or offered back for copy-pas=
ting, in both cases we need someone to create that html form, so the reques=
t for someone to join the team and work on that still stands! :)

Yes, and as it should be validated anyway, you can also create the JSON sch=
ema already and use that to validate the form. ;)

Cheers,
Sebastian
