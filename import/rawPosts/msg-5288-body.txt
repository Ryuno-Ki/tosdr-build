This seems more like a "if you allow a third party application access to=20
your account, we'll share your info with them" because you've consented to=
=20
the third party. I think this is pretty normal nowadays, especially since=
=20
so many services allow you to sign up via Facebook. Here's what I propose:

Title: Dropbox won't share your information with third parties without your=
=20
consent

Topic: Third Parties

Summary: Dropbox will share your personal information with a third-party=20
only if you allow said third party application access to your account.

Score: 30 (good)
