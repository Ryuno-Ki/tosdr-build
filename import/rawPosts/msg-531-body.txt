First, it could have helped to include
https://github.com/tosdr/tosdr.org/issues/
These issues are "priority" and known for about six months.

I am not sure these technical discussions are interesting to the group.
This mailing-list is a place where anyone, just by sending an email, can
contribute to the discussion about terms; and also thanks to the google
group web interface we can easily link to the discussions from the
website.

When discussiong github etc, this is something that should remain on top
of our head. The threshold of first contribution right now is very, very
low and we should keep it that way. What's actually needed is to work
with tools between that first step (the mailing-list) and the second
step (writing json data that displays on the website).

The form should not be a big issue at first. It is only a few forms that
are basically the same as the json fields (as soon as we have a version
1 of that JSON data). In the future maybe these forms could be enhanced
for instance by submitting directly from a website's TOS page through a
web extension.

What's very important is that we can keep in synch between the json data
and the discussion. That means that for every json data generated by the
form, there must be a link where people can discuss this data easily
(right now this is done in this mailing-list).

The way we did it is: every point/ has an id. This id is the same as the
google group topic id. But being able to make the link between them
automatically is not completely trivial. That's why the "backlog list"
feature is very, very important too.
See https://github.com/tosdr/tosdr.org/issues/47

With such a backlog list, we could have a central place where people
could help the review to happen by pushing up and down and tracking
topics in the mailing list that haven't been dealt with already.
