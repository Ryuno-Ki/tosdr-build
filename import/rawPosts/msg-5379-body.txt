So maybe something like this:

Topic: Suspension and censorship

=20
or government agency; if their service is discontinued; if there are=20

if you engage in illegal activities; or if you don't pay any fees you owe=
=20
to Yahoo!, they may, without prior notice, terminate, limit your access to,=
=20
or suspend your account.

Score: 40 (mediocre)
