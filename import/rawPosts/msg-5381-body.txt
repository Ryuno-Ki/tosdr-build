Wikipedia is a much more publicly-policed (for lack of a better term) 
service. Anyone can add/edit content on that site and it's just as easy for 
someone to come in a correct it or change it back to how it was originally. 
It's a more pro-active site in that regard. I'm personally not terribly 
familiar with many Yahoo! services, but I doubt they have a similar setup. 
For example, if someone posts inappropriate content that violates Yahoo! 
tos, that person gets reported and Yahoo! can delete their account, whereas 
the same isn't true of Wikipedia (as far as I know). This makes the 
indemnity clause, broad though it may be, more important for a service like 
Yahoo! as compared to Wikipedia.
