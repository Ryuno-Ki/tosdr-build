http://vimeo.com/terms

     By submitting a video, you grant Vimeo and its affiliates a
     limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license and
     right to copy, transmit, distribute, publicly perform and
     display (through all media now known or hereafter created),
     and make derivative works from your video for the purpose of
     (i) displaying the video within the Vimeo Service; (ii)
     displaying the video on third party websites and applications
     through a video embed or Vimeo's API subject to your video
     privacy choices; (iii) allowing other users to play,
     download, and embed on third party websites the video,
     subject to your video privacy choices; (iii) promoting the
     Vimeo Service, provided that you have made the video publicly
     available; and (iv) archiving or preserving the video for
     disputes, legal proceedings, or investigations.

Let me again show YouTube's:

    by submitting Content to YouTube, you hereby grant YouTube a
    worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and
    transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare
    derivative works of, display, and perform the Content in
    connection with the Service and YouTube's (and its successors'
    and affiliates') business, including without limitation for
    promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service (and
    derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any
    media channels. You also hereby grant each user of the Service
    a non-exclusive license to access your Content through the
    Service, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and
    perform such Content as permitted through the functionality of
    the Service and under these Terms of Service.

There are 2 major differences:

 - Vimeo's license is not transferable, nor sublicensable
 - Vimeo's license is limited for the purposes set in the license
   explicitly

You will probably realise that Vimeo also wants the license for
their affiliates and they also want to use your videos to promote
their service. But as long as it's clear, I don't see anything 
wrong with that.

I consider this license to be okay, especially in light of many
other copyright practices out there.
