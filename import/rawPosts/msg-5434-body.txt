        GOVERNING LAW: This Agreement shall be governed by the
        laws of the State of New York, United States of America,
        without regard to principles of conflicts of law. The
        Uniform Commercial Code, the Uniform Computer Information
        Transaction Act, and the United Nations Convention of
        Controls for International Sale of Goods shall not apply.

        DISPUTES: Any action arising out of or relating to this
        Agreement or your use of the Vimeo Service must be
        commenced in the state or federal courts located in New
        York County, New York, United States of America (and you
        consent to the jurisdiction of those courts). In any such
        action, Vimeo and you irrevocably waive any right to a
        trial by jury.

I wonder what they mean by 'you waive any right to a trial by
jury'. Do they mean any right to trial by jury outside of NY or
any right to trial by jury even in NY (in that case I don't
understand what they want exactly).

My very little knowledge of procedural law in the US fails me here :-)
