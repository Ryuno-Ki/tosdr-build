<br>Le mardi 10 juillet 2012 =E0 08:56 +0300, Michiel de Jong a =E9crit :
<br>&gt; cool! i also found out some more shocking practices regarding cook=
ies:
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; even if you delete your cookies or even in private browsing mode,
<br>&gt; websites have ways to cookie you, for instance using Flash
<br>&gt; <a href=3D"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_shared_object" targe=

Tags" target=3D"_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/<wbr>HTTP_ETag#Trackin=
g_using_ETags</a>
<br>&gt; or using html5 localStorage. check this out:
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; "over 5,600 standard HTTP cookies on popular sites, over 4,900 wer=
e
<br>&gt; from third parties. Google-controlled cookies were present on 97 o=
f
<br>&gt; the top 100 sites, including popular government websites."
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; third party cookies are evil and unnecessary. it's one thing to co=
okie
<br>&gt; your users yourself, but why would you presume the right to give y=
our
<br>&gt; users a third-party cookie without their consent?
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; "We found two sites that were respawning cookies, including one si=
te =96
<br>&gt; <a href=3D"http://hulu.com" target=3D"_blank">hulu.com</a> =96 whe=
re both Flash and cache cookies were employed to make
<br>&gt; identifiers more persistent. The cache cookie method used ETags, a=
nd
<br>&gt; is capable of unique tracking even where all cookies are blocked b=
y
<br>&gt; the user and =93Private Browsing Mode=94 is enabled."

98390" target=3D"_blank">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/<wbr>papers.cfm?abstra=
ct_id=3D1898390</a>
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; so the "well, people know they risk getting cookied when they go
<br>&gt; online, and everybody who cares about privacy will have cookies
<br>&gt; disabled" excuse doesn't apply there.
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; i really think that when we see third-party cookies, we should pun=
ish
<br>&gt; both the second party and the third party, so in 97% of websites,
<br>&gt; google, but facebook's like button is also all over the web. maybe=
 in
<br>&gt; case of the TweetThis widget we can be more forgiving because Twit=
ter
<br>&gt; takes the effort to delete your tracked data after 10 days, which =
is
<br>&gt; at least a gesture of goodwill. Although a gesture of goodwill
<br>&gt; sometimes means something else is being covered up, for instance,
<br>&gt; twitter probably monetizes on your data within 10 days because the=
y
<br>&gt; are about fast-moving topics.
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; i think maybe we should not give class A unless a website has an
<br>&gt; explicit "we don't track you" policy.
