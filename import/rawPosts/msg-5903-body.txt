&gt;<br>
&gt; Hugo, what is your stance on reverse-engineering by itself? (so<br>
&gt; strictly looking at how something works, without necessarily<br>
&gt; publishing a competing product based on what you learned from it).<br>
<br>
Considering that most of it is not published as free software, =A0I<br>
suppose it&#39;s expected to have this kind of clauses. On the other<br>
hand, there are many countries, including the US, where the law<br>
would still protect you against this kind of clauses.<br>
<br>
So in the end:<br>
<br>
=A0- services which are not free software are already kind of<br>
=A0 =A0downgraded when we will have a free-software-filter<br>
=A0- these kind of clauses don&#39;t hold much water anyway<br>
=A0- most people wouldn&#39;t care about them<br>
<br>
So I&#39;m in favour of mostly ignoring these clauses, unless they&#39;re<b=

really relevant to the service.<br>
