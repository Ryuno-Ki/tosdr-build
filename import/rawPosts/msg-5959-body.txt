It would be awesome if you did mention which services can be used by folks 
under 13 and which can't. For parents, teachers, and children, this is the 
#1 issue. There are tons of good software services that do make themselves 
available to folks under 13, either by integrating with Google Apps For 
Education or by another means. Even Facebook is making an effort here.

Are you sure you want to leave this info out of your reviews?
