<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; [3] (good) Use of real name not required.
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; Anyone with Internet access (and not otherwise restricted from=
 doing so)
<br>&gt;&gt; may edit the publicly editable pages of these sites with or wi=
thout logging
<br>&gt;&gt; in as a registered user.
<br>&gt;&gt; ...
<br>&gt;&gt; The Foundation does not require editors to register with a pro=
ject. Anyone
<br>&gt;&gt; can edit without logging in with a username, in which case the=
y will be
<br>&gt;&gt; identified by network IP address. Users that do register are i=
dentified by
<br>&gt;&gt; their chosen username.
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; [4] (good) Personal info is only used for running the service.
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; The Foundation limits the collection of personally identifiabl=
e user data
<br>&gt;&gt; to purposes which serve the well-being of its projects (list o=
f uses related
<br>&gt;&gt; to preventing abuse).
<br>&gt;&gt; ...
<br>&gt;&gt; To provide site statistics. The Foundation statistically sampl=
es raw log
<br>&gt;&gt; data from users' visits. These logs are used to produce the si=
te statistics
<br>&gt;&gt; pages; the raw log data is not made public.
<br>&gt;&gt; To solve technical problems. Log data may be examined by devel=
opers in the
<br>&gt;&gt; course of solving technical problems and in tracking down badl=
y-behaved web
<br>&gt;&gt; spiders that overwhelm the site.
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; [5] (note) User's IP may be used as permanently available publ=
ic
<br>&gt;&gt; identification. Better privacy available in form of being a re=
gistered user.
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; For editors who do not log in, the IP address used is publicly=
 and
<br>&gt;&gt; permanently credited as the author of the edit. It may be poss=
ible for a
<br>&gt;&gt; third party to identify the author from this IP address in con=
junction with
<br>&gt;&gt; other information available. Logging in with a registered user=
name allows
<br>&gt;&gt; for better preservation of privacy.
<br>&gt;&gt; ...
<br>&gt;&gt; Edits to Project pages are identified with the username or net=
work IP
<br>&gt;&gt; address of the editor, and editing history is aggregated by au=
thor in a
<br>&gt;&gt; contribution list. Such information will be available permanen=
tly on the
<br>&gt;&gt; projects.
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; [6] (good) Cookies optional if just viewing pages. Cookies use=
d for
<br>&gt;&gt; logins/edits.
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; The sites set a temporary session cookie on a visitor's comput=
er whenever
<br>&gt;&gt; a Project page is visited. Readers who do not intend to log in=
 or edit may
<br>&gt;&gt; deny this cookie; it will be deleted at the end of the browser=
's session.
<br>&gt;&gt; More cookies may be set when one logs in to maintain logged-in=
 status. If
<br>&gt;&gt; one saves a user name or password in one's browser, that infor=
mation will be
<br>&gt;&gt; saved for up to 30 days, and this information will be resent t=
o the server
<br>&gt;&gt; on every visit to the same Project. Contributors using a publi=
c machine who
<br>&gt;&gt; do not wish to show their username to future users of the mach=
ine should
<br>&gt;&gt; clear these cookies after use.
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; [7] (good) Personal info disclosed to law enforcement by court=
 order only.
<br>&gt;&gt; User is notified.
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; As a general principle, the access to, and retention of, perso=
nally
<br>&gt;&gt; identifiable data in all projects should be minimal and should=
 be used only
<br>&gt;&gt; internally to serve the well-being of the projects. Occasional=
ly, however,
<br>&gt;&gt; the Foundation may receive a subpoena or other compulsory requ=
est from a
<br>&gt;&gt; law-enforcement agency or a court or equivalent government bod=
y that
<br>&gt;&gt; requests the disclosure of information about a registered user=
, and may be
<br>&gt;&gt; compelled by law to comply with the request. In the event of s=
uch a legally
<br>&gt;&gt; compulsory request, the Foundation will attempt to notify the =
affected user
<br>&gt;&gt; within three business days after the arrival of such subpoena =
by sending a
<br>&gt;&gt; notice by email to the email address (if any) that the affecte=
d user has
<br>&gt;&gt; listed in his or her user preferences.

<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; [8] (note?) Users are legally responsible for their own contri=
butions and
<br>&gt;&gt; actions.
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; Section 1.b
<br>&gt;&gt; You are responsible for your own actions: You are legally resp=
onsible for
<br>&gt;&gt; your edits and contributions on Wikimedia Projects, so for you=
r own
<br>&gt;&gt; protection you should exercise caution and avoid contributing =
any content
<br>&gt;&gt; that may result in criminal or civil liability under any appli=
cable laws.
<br>&gt;&gt; For clarity, applicable law includes at least the laws of the =
United States
<br>&gt;&gt; of America. Although we may not agree with such actions, we wa=
rn editors and
<br>&gt;&gt; contributors that authorities may seek to apply other country =
laws to you,
<br>&gt;&gt; including local laws where you live or where you view or edit =
content. WMF
<br>&gt;&gt; generally cannot offer any protection, guarantee, immunity or
<br>&gt;&gt; indemnification.
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; [9] (good) User contributions licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 and =
GFDL.
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; Section 7.a
<br>&gt;&gt; Text to which you hold the copyright: When you submit text to =

<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; [10] (good) You may cancel at any time.
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; Though we hope you will stay and continue to contribute to the=
 Projects,
<br>&gt;&gt; you can stop using our services any time.
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; [11] (note) Jurisdiction in California.
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; If you seek to file a legal claim against us, you agree to fil=
e and
<br>&gt;&gt; resolve it exclusively in a state or federal court located in =
San Francisco
<br>&gt;&gt; County, California. You also agree that the laws of the State =
of California
<br>&gt;&gt; and, to the extent applicable, the laws of the United States o=
f America will
<br>&gt;&gt; govern these Terms of Use, as well as any legal claim that mig=
ht arise
<br>&gt;&gt; between you and us (without reference to conflict of laws prin=
ciples). You
<br>&gt;&gt; agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of, and agree tha=
t venue is
<br>&gt;&gt; proper in, the courts located in San Francisco County, Califor=
nia, in any
<br>&gt;&gt; legal action or proceeding relating to us or these Terms of Us=
e.
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; [12] (good) Community included in modifications to ToU. Notifi=
cations
<br>&gt;&gt; provided via website.
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; Just as the Wikimedia community's input is essential for the g=
rowth and
<br>&gt;&gt; maintenance of the Projects, we believe that community input i=
s essential
<br>&gt;&gt; for these Terms of Use to properly serve our users. It is also=
 essential for
<br>&gt;&gt; a fair contract. Therefore, we will provide these Terms of Use=
, as well as
<br>&gt;&gt; any substantial future revisions of these Terms of Use, to the=
 community for
<br>&gt;&gt; comment at least thirty (30) days before the end of the commen=
t period.
<br>&gt;&gt; ...
<br>&gt;&gt; Because it may be necessary to modify these Terms of Use from =
time to
<br>&gt;&gt; time, we will provide notice of such modifications and the opp=
ortunity to
<br>&gt;&gt; comment via the Project websites, and via a notification on
<br>&gt;&gt; WikimediaAnnounce-L.
