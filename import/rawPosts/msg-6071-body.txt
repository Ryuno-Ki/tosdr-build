I'd say 80 is fine, but the value is meaningless to me out of context: I 
don't know where the numerical line between "Class C" and "Class D" is, for 
instance. I'd put a class action waiver in our Class D, while the 
arbitration clause is maybe Class C, maybe Class B, depending on how it's 
written. A class action waiver isn't a showstopper, but it's a point of 
concern that should draw a consumer's attention.

Ian, I know you work really hard to keep everything well-curated and 
consistent, and I don't want to put more work on you, but would it make 
sense to have baseline scores for certain clauses? For instance, an 
arbitration agreement is a baseline of ...40 (is that Class B?), and can go 
up or down depending on how it's written. A class action waiver is a 
baseline of 80. Is that how things are already done? It would keep things 
consistent from agreement to agreement, with the understanding that clauses 
are worded differently, and some are worded to be more consumer-friendly 
than others, so scores will fluctuate a little.

I'd be happy to work on that with you, if you need someone to take a closer 
look at legal language in some of these.
