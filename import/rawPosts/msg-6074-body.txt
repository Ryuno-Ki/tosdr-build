The Classes are a result of the sum of the scores of individual data points=
 from a service's ToS and privacy policy, so we couldn't just say "X clause=
 goes into Class C". What we can, and strive to do, is give the same score =
for the same clause. So, ideally all arbitration clauses are 50 (or whateve=
r), etc.=20

At this point, we don't have baseline scores for certain clauses, but by cu=
rating multiple, similar clauses we arrive at one. Does that make sense? Fo=
r example, when I'm considering a score for a clause, I compare that clause=
 with clauses from other services we've already given scores to and use tha=
t information to determine the score I should award. I think having a basel=
ine score would be a good idea, though.

Hugo, do you care to weigh in on this?
