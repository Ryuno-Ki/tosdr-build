Because of how broad this is (aka, a user potentially has to accept 
responsibility for a mistake made by Amazon), I see this as a negative.

Title: Amazon isn't responsible for your account's confidentiality

Topic: governance

Summary: You are responsible for maintain your account's confidentiality. 
However, you also accept full responsibility for activities that occur 
under your account or password. So, if Amazon makes a mistake and it is 
somehow attributed to your account, you are responsible even if you knew 
nothing and had nothing to do with it. 

Score: 40 (mediocre)
