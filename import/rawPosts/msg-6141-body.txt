This, the license vs sale issue, has been a serious sticking point for=20
Kindle owners, and is a big problem in all digital goods. It has affected=
=20
Kindle owners several times already: in 2009, there was a class action=20
lawsuit<http://www.scribd.com/doc/17878326/Amazon-Complaint-Kindle-Ate-Home=
work-on-1984>against Amazon on behalf of Kindle owners over Amazon's deleti=
on of George=20
Orwell's *1984*. Amazon settled out of court<http://assets.bizjournals.com/=
cms_media/pdf/KindleCase1.pdf?site=3Dtechflash.com>,=20
so we don't have a ruling that gives users any new rights. Under the terms=
=20
of the settlement, Amazon agreed that it would not remotely delete works=20
from Kindles unless the user agrees to the deletion; the user fails to pay=
=20
for the book; a court or other regulatory order requires deletion; or=20
deletion is necessary to protect consumers from malicious code.

A year later, in December 2010, Amazon got into trouble *again* for deletin=
g=20
a whole bunch of erotica titles from its store<http://arstechnica.com/busin=
ess/2010/12/amazons-latest-kindle-deletion-erotic-incest-themed-fiction/>..=
.and=20
also deleting those titles from users' Kindle archives. When users=20
protested, Amazon restored the titles to the Kindle archives for those=20
users who had already purchased them, and called it a "technical issue."

Two years later, in October 2012, it happened again<http://boingboing.net/2=
012/10/22/kindle-user-claims-amazon-dele.html>:=20
Linn Nygaard purchased a Kindle in the UK and then returned to her home in=
=20
Norway, and continued to use her Kindle, buying books from Amazon's UK=20
store. After working fine for some time, Nygaard's Kindle developed a=20
technical problem, and she called Amazon's customer service to get it=20
replaced. Amazon then closed her account and deleted all her content, and=
=20
would not even explain to her why until her story got significant media=20
attention -- once the bad press started building up, Amazon reinstated her=
=20
account and restored her content <http://digitaljournal.com/article/335484>=
.

So...short version: Amazon has already been sued about this, and has=20
promised in court that it would severely restrict its ability to delete=20
content on users' Kindles. *That hasn't stopped Amazon from deleting=20
content on users' Kindles in ways not covered by the settlement.*

The bigger issue, as I mentioned above, is the license vs. sale issue for=
=20
digital goods. Unfortunately, after 2010's *Vernor v. Autodesk* decision,=
=20
courts support this structure. It means that no, you don't generally own=20
the content you buy online. You don't own the copies of the songs you buy=
=20
on iTunes. You don't own the copies of games you download off Steam. That's=
=20
what your end user *license* agreement is telling you: you license them,=20
which basically means you're just borrowing them.

In terms of ToS:DR, it's something you can flag if you want to, because=20
it's something people *should* care about...but it's how *everything* is=20
done. Digital content is almost always licensed, not sold -- to find copies=
=20
actually, explicitly *sold* online is the exception, rather than the rule.=
=20
It's another of those situations where red-flagging *everything* will end=
=20
up giving the user less information, not more.

Sorry for being super-wordy here.

Hannah=20

<br>Yes, that means you don't own anything.
