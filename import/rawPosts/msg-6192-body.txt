Hi Nar, so sorry I'm only just getting to this point. This is indeed bad, 
although not uncommon (see Amazon, for example). The wording is usually a 
little different, with a clause like this accompanied by "in our sole 
discretion" or something similar. Here's what I propose for this point:

Title: Skype can terminate your account at any time

Topic: Suspension and censorship

Summary: Skype can terminate your account at any time if they reasonably 
suspect your misuse of their software, services, and/or any of their 
policies. 

Score: 50 (mediocre)
