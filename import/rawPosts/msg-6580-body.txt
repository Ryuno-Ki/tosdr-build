Title: You can opt out of Apple's targeted advertising

Topic: user-info

Summary: Although Apple, like many services, uses cookies to provide 
targeted advertising, they do provide a link (http://oo.apple.com) to opt 
out of these ads on your mobile device. You'll still receive ads, but they 
won't be as relevant as any previous targeted ads.

Score: 30 (good)
