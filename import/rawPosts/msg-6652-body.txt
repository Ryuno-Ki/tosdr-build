Title: Tumblr uses third-party cookies

Topic: cookies

Summary: In addition to functional cookies that Tumblr uses, they also use 
Google Analytics and Quantcast, which may place their own cookies on your 
browser. This is invasive, and they do not provide an opt-out method for 
these third-party cookies.

Score: 50 (mediocre)
