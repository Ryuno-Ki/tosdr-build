seems pretty reasonable to me. Insurance is not their product. We 
should define a review policy about liability limits. How about:

- if insurance is reasonably part of the product, for instance if the 
product is "piano transport", then it's reasonable that they 
automatically insure up to the value of the piano (maybe as an opt-out). 
in all other cases, it's ok for a service to limit their liability for 
damage caused by the use of the service. for instance, when using a 
cloud storage service, the user should always keep a backup of important 
files.

- it is OK to assign a specific dispute handler and a specific court of 
law (within reason), but it is not OK for any service to include a class 
action waiver, a jury trial waiver, or any other waivers that reduce the 
protection the user enjoys from the way the laws of their country were 
designed. the '(within reason)' note here means that if you say "the 
court of law is the Matabumi Islands", with the specific purpose of 
choosing a court of law that will favor the service, then that's bad, 
but otherwise if you choose any "normal" country or state, then that's 
ok.

- it is OK to say the user is responsible for their behavior when using 
the service, and that they shouldn't knowingly get the service into 
trouble by their way of using the service. but it is not OK for the 
service to say the user must indemnify them and hold them harmless. 
that's just silly and asymmetrical. it is up to the law to say whether 
the user has hurt the company, and it of course the user should pay up 
any penalties the court decides on, but it is not fair to put an 
asymmetrical clause about that in the terms.
