In going over this, I'm not sure how relevant it is to tosdr. I understand 
that providing a way to report copyright infringement is a good thing, but 
I also feel that it is a natural extension of "don't do anything illegal". 
That just seems like common sense to me. I'll leave this for now, but 
welcome any discussion on it.
