<br>seems pretty reasonable to me. Insurance is not their product. We 
<br>should define a review policy about liability limits. How about:
<br>
<br>- if insurance is reasonably part of the product, for instance if the 
<br>product is "piano transport", then it's reasonable that they 
<br>automatically insure up to the value of the piano (maybe as an opt-out). 
<br>in all other cases, it's ok for a service to limit their liability for 
<br>damage caused by the use of the service. for instance, when using a 
<br>cloud storage service, the user should always keep a backup of important 
<br>files.
