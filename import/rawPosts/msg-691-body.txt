All of these points seem reasonable to me. It seems logical that a business 
would choose a jurisdiction where the business is based. It would also be 
unfair to expect a business to be available worldwide knowing that there 
are tons of laws that they would have to be aware of and follow in order to 
exist in some places. This and multiple jurisdictions go hand-in-hand, I 
think. The good-faith attempt to be globally available by Google is also a 
good thing, and should be regarded as such with other services.
