17.1.2 
Arbitration of Most Disputes. If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth 
in Section 17.1.1 within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then 
either you or we may submit the Dispute to formal arbitration in accordance 
with this Section 17.1, unless it is an Excluded Dispute, which shall be 
handled in accordance with Section 17.2.

17.1.3 Arbitrator. Upon expiration of the applicable sixty (60)-day period 
and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a Dispute will be 
resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current 
JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures of JAMS, Inc. ("JAMS"). 
JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information are available, as follows:

Summary: If you have a dispute with Myspace, you must write a notice 
describing the dispute, along with a proposed resolution. Myspace will 
engage in a dialogue for 60 days in an attempt to resolve the dispute. If 
the dispute is not resolved in 60 days, the dispute may be submitted for 
formal arbitration. 

For the purposes of TOS Didn't read, providing information via the browser 
app, that's all well and good. People can get a feeling of what the terms 
are, and decide whether or not to accept them and use the service at 
myspace.
