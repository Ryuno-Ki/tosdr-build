Title: Instagram can delete your access for any reason, without notice

Topic: suspension

Summary: Instagram's terms of service grant them the right to modify or end 
your access to their service for any reason, at any time, without telling 
you. In addition, Instagram can also refuse access to their service to 
anyone for any reason, at any time. This is easily one of most extreme 
examples of these clauses.

Score: 150 (alert)
