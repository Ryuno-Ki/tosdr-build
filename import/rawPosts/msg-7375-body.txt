*Additional information regarding the complexity of Myspace TOS and Privacy 
Policies.*

Myspace calls their terms 'Terms of Use' TOU, rather than TOS
*The main 'Terms' document is located here:* https://myspace.com/pages/terms

The main TOU references three additional policy documents linked within the 
text:

*1. Video Privacy policy*
https://myspace.com/pages/videoprivacy

*2. Cookie policy*
https://myspace.com/pages/cookiepolicy

*3.. The main 'Privacy' terms document*  https://myspace.com/pages/privacy

Section 13. Privacy and Communications of the TOU additionally references:


   - *Law Enforcement Guidelines*
   
The inline text link to 'Law Enforcement Guides' *redirects* from the main 
domain (Myspace) to '*askmyspace'* main 'help section',
https://www.askmyspace.com/t5/Legal-Policy/bg-p/legal

( The 'Legal + Policy' section is (currently) located** at the bottom of 
the page, and you may have to scroll to see it. Then you have to click 
twice to get to the actual Law Enforcement Guidelines)

*The Law Enforcement Guidelines* are located at 
]https://www.askmyspace.com/t5/Legal-Policy/Law-Enforcement-Guidelines/ba-p/38505


Section 10: Protecting Copyrights and Other Intellectual Property
--- similarly references additional documents in the askmyspace 'Legal + 
Policy' section, but does not reference them by name.

Three are informational

   - Trademark FAQs
   - Copyright FAQs
   - Copyright and Trademark
   

Two outline DCMA Take down and Put back

   - Reporting Copyright Infringement
   - How to file copyright infringement counter-notification
   

And one, which doesn't seem to be directly linked in or referenced from the 
main TOS document

   - *Trademark Infringement Policy*
   
https://www.askmyspace.com/t5/Legal-Policy/Trademark-Infringement-Policy/ba-p/1419

** The reason I use the word 'currently' is because the 'help section of 
askmyspace has been shuffled around at least 4 times since the 12 June 2013 
launch of 'new' myspace.
