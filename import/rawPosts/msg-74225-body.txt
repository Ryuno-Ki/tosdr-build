Hello,

Obviously one of the most important issues that's addressed in ToS is
the copyright license. Not all services are equal in this regard,
especially between services where the user operate in private and
services where the user shares / publishes content with other people /
with the world.

        With this first topic, I'd like to gather some comparative
        information and discuss what seems to be a fair balance between
        needs to operate the service and rights of the authors & the
        public. Then we could try to categorize them and give them a
        rating.

The first thing to discuss obviously is the scope of the copyright
license. Some of the ToS out there seems to go as far as they can get in
scope. It seems to me that the biggest difference are:
      * some ToS don't grant a specifically large license to the
        operator of the service but fall back on a copyright public
        license e.g. creative commons=20
      * some ToS require the ability to transfer, sublicense with others
        (sometimes it is limited to the partners e.g. Twitter Partners)

Do I miss anything substantial?
