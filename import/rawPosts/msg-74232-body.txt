Subject: Re: What's the right balance in a copyright license for publishing
 over "social networks"?

this is 'Ownership' on http://tos-dr.info/

i would distinguish three user stories: publishing publicly,
publishing to a limited audience, uploading for private use.

in the first case, obviously you need to grant a license, and i think
it doesn't matter if this is transferrable or creative commons - it is
understood that what you publish will be public. i would give points
to websites that make it clear that something will be public. some
have a warning saying "watch out: public means public!"

in the second case, the site should only get a license to publish the
content to the intended audience, plus sysadmin access. any secondary
data that is generated should only be used for product improvement and
not for advertising, and definitely not for profiling.

additionally, the site will disclose your data to the police whenever
required to do so by law, but i don't think they need to put that
explicitly in the ToS, do they? i think they should get points if they
point this out to you, and also if they warn you whenever this happens
(this is point 'law enforcement').

in the third case, it's the same as the second case, except that the
intended audience is just you.

cheers!
Michiel
