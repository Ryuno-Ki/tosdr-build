Right, it also touches upon the relationship w/ 3rd parties.

So what about a case where for instance on SeenThis you can publish
under a CC-non commercial license, or a non-derivative? Compare that to
Twitter which gets granted more rights, including to display on /all/
media (so typically outside twitter.com, even on paper).

I personally like the CC approach better, especially when it's
advertised clearly. That way the user is aware quite clearly of the
copyright license that's applying to uploaded content. Also, the
operator and other people are treated equally.

I'm not sure that all users of Facebook realise that uploading a picture
equals granting a very, very broad copyright license (provided that the
ToS copyright license clause is valid and enforceable). IMHO that's not
particularly required for a "social network" or even for publication.
Then what about ToS that govern several of the use-cases you describe.

Wordpress.com in contrast to Facebook, is limited to the first case you
describe. In that case, they precise that the copyright license is
limited to Automattic (nothing about transfert AFAIK) and operates
"solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing and promoting your
blog." That makes a big difference IMO.

I agree but that's typically not reflected in most ToS. Hard to keep
track of this equally for all services.

Yes, I don't think the government asks for a copyright license to access
content :)

Yes, I agree. That's for another topic though.
