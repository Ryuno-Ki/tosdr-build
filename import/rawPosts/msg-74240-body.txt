i think we would have to put that in context and try to relate it to
the user story. For a tweet, derivatives don't make much sense,
although i heard of a case where if you mention a brand, that brand
then gets advertised to your friends with your photo in the ad. that
would be a commercial derivative i guess. :)

is a quote a derivative? is this email, quoting the text from your
email, a derivative of it? i guess so. you could now probably sue me
because i'm reusing unlicensed material. ;)

non-commercial sounds reasonable for derivatives (e.g. someone
compiles a book of your tweets and gets rich) but not for the original
published context, it is quite widely accepted that the site may
display ads on the same page, and that would violate a non-commercial
license, right?

so my conclusion would be:
- if the service does not display ads, then that's a plus, but that's
then probably for the whole service, and doesn't seem to be a feature
of the content licensing, more of the service's mission statement
- commercial derivatives should not be allowed i think

that's definitely a good thing, and that's obviously why identica
chose it, and i think that should be rewarded.

the problem there is that the license is granted at the moment of
uploading, and unlike twitter, uploading to facebook is not publishing
publicly. what license does twitter get over direct messages?

yes, that's how it should be, right? i don't understand why it's so
hard for other services to get that right ;)

well, there is documented evidence of user studies about oversharing
on facebook. it is misleading on purpose. we should quote that
research, and penalize facebook for it.
