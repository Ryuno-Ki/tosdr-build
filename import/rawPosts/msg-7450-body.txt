Unfortunately, I don't think it's terribly useful. I think if they listed 
any specific programmes to help users anonymise their web usage, that would 
be different. That would be something worth mentioning to users for sure. 
It is nice that they at least acknowledge that some users will want an 
anonymous browsing experience, even if they don't direct you to specific 
ways to do that.
