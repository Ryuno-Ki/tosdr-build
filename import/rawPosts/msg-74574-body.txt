we also talked about this last night, and Jan agrued that inducing
oversharing on purpose, against the interests of the user, is not evil
because (if i understood correctly) the user should understand that
facebook is not to be trusted, and the only way to be safe is not to
use facebook at all. I think it's evil, just like adding addictive
substances to cigarettes is evil. Sure, people still make the choice
to smoke or not, but there's a government warning on the package for a
reason.

So likewise, tosdr should tell users "it's up to you whether you want
to use this class E website", and not "we rate this website class A
because surely you understand that even a class A website can and will
do nasty things to you". We should only give a good classification if
the website does not do things that are against the interest of the
user.
