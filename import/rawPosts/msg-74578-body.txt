That is a weird way to synthesise our discussion :)

Let me synthesise my position:
      * rating the UI is too subjective and it is going to far: you rate
        facebook's UI because it's under scrutiny. Why don't you do it
        evenly for other services?=20
      * there's nothing wrong for the developers to try to push their
        users to do something, they still have a right to develop the
        product they want. In other words: if Facebook wants to be more
        of a public sharing platform than of a private/very-limited
        sharing platform they have the right to do it. To impose _your_
        personal vision of what facebook should be to both faceboook
        developers and to users who enjoy to publish everything they do
        is wrong. In that case, Twitter also encourages 'oversharing'
        because the default and the UI makes it public. Is that wrong?
        No, if the user understands from the beginning that they give
        the license to Twitter to do it.
      * it is looking at the wrong problem. What we're doing is giving
        the user the keys to understand what rights he's agreeing on
        about with the service.  The ToS give us quite a clear picture
        already that the license is _so broad for everything_ that
        Facebook does not fit for private sharing, regardless of what
        the UI looks like!

TL;DR: too difficult and subjective to rate; the UI practices are going
to be reflected in the ToS anyway; it's better to focus on ToS because
they give a clearer picture of what's the service going to do (or able
to do).
