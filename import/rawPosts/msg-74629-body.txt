right, i just imagined being 16 years old (which is a 20 year
stretching of my imagination, so it wasn't easy ;) and visited
https://flattr.com/register

I would have just signed up there, i would have ticked the box without
even clicking on the ToS link, and would never have read the sentence
(which i found by searching for '18' in the page, i really agree with
Hugo that https://flattr.com/terms is too long):

"The Service is available only to individuals who are at least 18
years old, whether acting on their own behalf or as authorised
employees or representatives of an entity. If you do not so qualify,
do not attempt to register for or use the Service."

The question is what would happen after that? probably, i would be
using the service without any problems and without even knowing that i
was breaking the ToS. Is that OK? if the 'you must be 18' rule is
stupid, then i think it's ok. but if the 'you must be 18' rule is
there to protect minors against the dangers of (for instance) accruing
credit card debt, then i think it's not OK, and it would be better to
do it the way eBay does it.

so the question is, i guess, where does this requirement come from,
and is it ok to bury it so deep into the text?
