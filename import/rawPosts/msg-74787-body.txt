It seems that more and more website since last year have decided to
adopt a somehow better approach to handle changes in Terms of Services.
Facebook is no exception to that trend as we can see from the last
changes in April 2012.

http://www.zdnet.com/blog/facebook/facebook-tweaks-terms-of-use-based-on-feedback-asks-for-more/12024
        The company gave users a week to give feedback. After examining
        the thousands of comments it received, Facebook has made further
        tweaks to its terms of use document, and has opened up another
        comment period. 

The process was translated.

According to some articles the feedback was taken into account (i.e. the
process resulted in changes). But how relevant this is can be subject of
discussion. However we have to acknowledge the effort that's put in that
process and that deserves an A.
