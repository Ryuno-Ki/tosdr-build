One of the biggest problems with general terms of service is that they
are usually changed unilaterally by the operator.

Twitter ToS actually states indeed:
        We may revise these Terms from time to time, the most current
        version will always be at twitter.com/tos. If the revision, in
        our sole discretion, is material we will notify you via an
        @Twitter update or e-mail to the email associated with your
        account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those
        revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised
        Terms
        
I don't remember when was the last time that Twitter changed their ToS.
So it is hard to compare what this notification means in practise
(especially compared to Facebook's last practise of soliciting user
feedback with an organised process).

However if we look a bit further back in time we can find that Twitter
has deeply changed the nature of the terms.
http://scinfolex.wordpress.com/2009/09/12/petit-oiseau-devient-gourmand-a-propos-des-nouvelles-conditions-dutilisation-de-twitter/ (French)

In substance whereas Twitter before claimed no license to the
copyrighted materials (it even mentioned "We encourage users to
contribute their creations to the public domain or consider progressive
licensing terms." which is exactly what SeenThis or Identi.ca are doing,
see https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/tosdr/kizrN7qb1Ck
) the ToS have changed that in September 2009. The current ToS stay
pretty much the same and allows Twitter to transfer the license to
third-parties in exchange for a fee for instance (and they did, as
Calimaq explains here in French again
http://scinfolex.wordpress.com/2012/03/09/sommes-nous-en-train-de-nous-faire-plumer-par-twitter/ )

So considering the past experience in Twitter TOS changes. Should we
consider that the current policy of notification is "good enough"?

Regarding the very substantial changes that Twitter has been through, I
would say no. That's a class C or below.
