I have to say, I'm amazed by how much Facebook succeeds in tearing down
any positive aspect that I can find in it.  This was a fast one (2
months).

So in a nutshell, while I was praising facebook for their new practices
of soliciting feedback from their users before launching new policies or
terms and lauded their effort in setting up such a process; I now must
contradict myself and point out how ridiculous the implementation is.

Lack Of Participation Makes Facebook Privacy Policy Vote Non-Binding

        A seven-day voting period regarding whether Facebook should
        adopt a new privacy and user rights policy or continue using the
        existing one has come and gone, and despite an overwhelming
        percentage of voters choosing the current regulations, the
        revised code will be implemented by the popular social network.
       =20
        The reason, explains Casey Johnston of Ars Technica, is that a
        minimum of 270 million individuals, or 30% of all Facebook
        members, needed to cast their vote in order for it the results
        to be binding.
       =20
        Only 342,632 (or approximately 0.038% of the website=92s 900
        million plus user base) did so, with slightly less than 300,000
        voting against the new Statement of Rights and Responsibilities
        (SRR) and Data Use Policy and 45,000 voting against it, she
        added. As such, Facebook will only consider the results =93in an
        advisory manner as it mulls a change over its new policies,=94
        Johnston said.
       =20
        =93The vote was triggered because a critical mass of people had
        commented on the proposed policies =97 seven times the amount
        needed, in fact,=94 CNET=91s Elinor Mills wrote on Friday

Today I'll focus on Facebook's way of updating their policy to find out
what exactly is set up there; as this new development plainly
contradicts what has been reported in April.
