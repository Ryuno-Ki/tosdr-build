Sorry, I got a bit lost in the maze of Facebook's policies. Not having a
Facebook account any more doesn't really help :) I haven't been able to
find the documents that were available for the vote. I guess they must
be somewhere and very valuable as they're supposed to enlighten the
reader about the proposed changes in the Terms & Policies.

Anyway - I don't know what was the subject of the changes in April 2012
- but anyway here's what the general Terms state:
http://www.facebook.com/legal/terms

        13. Amendments
       =20
        We can change this Statement if we provide you notice (by
        posting the change on the Facebook Site Governance Page) and an
        opportunity to comment.  To get notice of any future changes to
        this Statement, visit our Facebook Site Governance Page and
        become a fan.
        [=85]
        we will give you a minimum of seven days notice. All such
        comments must be made on the Facebook Site Governance Page.
       =20
        If more than 7,000 users comment on the proposed change, we will
        also give you the opportunity to participate in a vote in which
        you will be provided alternatives.
       =20
That's all very laudable. So far, so good. Most ToS don't give such a
possibility.  But here comes the fun:
       =20
        The vote shall be binding on us if more than 30% of all active
        registered users as of the date of the notice vote.

Needless to say, that's laughable.  We can expect that this ratio means
the vote will never be a big risk for Facebook. The terms define the
base "active registered user" as "a user who has logged into Facebook at
least once in the previous 30 days."=20

So most estimates in the press that took into account the total user
base of Facebook (900 million) are wrong unless they researched that all
facebook users are active; which I doubt is the case.=20

The real question that is asked before ourselves here is the following:
        While Facebook has a process that allows 7,000 users to solicit
        a vote on a proposed change in terms upon notice of such
        proposal =97 the implementation of the vote requires an impossible
        participation rate in order to apply considering the low
        publicity the vote has gained.=20
       =20
Hence I propose to withdraw my former proposal to give an "A" (or +++)
to this and downgrade to B (or "+") (because this is still better than
other terms that can be changed by the operator of the service at any
time, just on notice).
