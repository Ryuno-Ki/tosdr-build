Explanation of changes
by Facebook Site Governance on Friday, May 11, 2012 at 8:52am =B7

We want to make sure you understand the proposed updates to the Data Use
Policy so we have included descriptions of the changes by section. While
we=92ve provided a lot of information below, the vast majority of the
proposed changes represent additional explanations of current practices
rather than substantive changes in how we use your data. We are
proposing three main categories of changes to our Data Use Policy:
(1) examples and explanations to enhance the descriptions of our
policies, many of which were based on recommendations from the Irish
Data Protection Commissioner=92s Office, the regulatory oversight agency
for our services outside the U.S. and Canada; (2) new language to
explain our policies around new features we=92ve launched or updated since
we last revised our Data Use Policy; and (3) administrative and
organizational changes.

=20

General

=20

Since the last revision to our Data Use Policy, we launched Facebook
Timeline. Therefore, we=92re changing =93profile=94 to =93timeline=94 and =
=93post=94
to =93story=94 throughout the Data Use Policy and including references to
features, like cover photos, that work with timeline.

=20

In addition, there were a few places where the Data Use Policy was
duplicative or where items would be more relevant in other sections. To
address those organizational issues, we consolidated a few discussions
into the sections where we thought they made the most sense.=20

=20

Section I. Information we receive and how it is used=20

This section explains the type of information we receive and how we use
that information. We have updated the policy in the following ways:


      * Your information and Information that is always publicly
        available. In these sections, we=92ve stated the kinds of
        information about you that are always public. For instance, your
        gender is public information, and we use your gender throughout
        the site to refer to you properly. And, as we=92ve explained
        throughout the Data Use Policy, your gender is shared with apps
        so they can refer to you properly as well. You will still be
        able to hide your gender on your timeline. In addition, cover
        photos are a new part of the Facebook experience, and we=92re
        updating the Data Use Policy to let you know that, just like
        your profile pictures, your cover photos are public. If you=92re
        uncomfortable with making your profile pictures or cover photos
        public, you can always delete them.
      * Information others share about you. We=92ve added some language to
        clarify how others may share information about you (for example,
        posting a picture of you or by uploading your contact
        information). In addition, we consolidated some language in this
        section about apps into the section entitled Controlling what
        information you share with applications.
      * Other information we receive about you. We=92ve provided
        additional descriptions around the ways we receive information
        about you when you interact with Facebook and how that
        information may be used. For example, we=92ve added clarifications
        about the types of data we receive about you when you use our
        mobile app. In addition, we have replaced the specific reference
        to data retention around advertisers with an overall data
        retention commitment, which is described below in How we use the
        information we receive.
      * Usernames and User IDs. The clarifications in this section
        provide further information about your Username and User ID,
        including that we will assign usernames and Facebook email
        addresses to your Facebook account if you have not selected them
        already. This makes it easier for you to tell friends how to
        find your timeline and for you to email people off Facebook.
      * How we use the information we receive. We receive information
        about you through your interaction with Facebook. In this
        section we=92re providing more examples of the ways we may use
        that data to continue to provide you with the best features and
        services possible. For example, we may use this data to deliver
        ads that are more relevant to you. We=92ve also included a
        reminder that when others share information about you, they
        control how that information is shared.


=20

In addition, we=92ve added new language that explains our overall
commitment around data retention: we will retain data for as long as
necessary to provide services to users and others. This broader
commitment applies to all data we collect and receive about you,
including information from advertisers. With respect to advertisers,
those relationships are evolving because of the different services we
provide. We will continue to retain data received from advertisers for
180 days where that length of time is necessary to provide services. But
there may be some times when we will need to keep information that we
get from an advertiser for longer than 180 days. For example, if an
advertiser creates a Facebook Page, we wouldn't delete information the
advertiser puts on its page simply because 180 days had passed. Instead,
we would delete it when it was no longer needed =97 when the page owner
deleted it or closed its account. The revisions in this section do not
change our commitment that we won't share information that personally
identifies you with advertisers without your permission.


      * Deleting and deactivating your account. We added tips to these
        two sections. One that clarifies that friends will see you in
        their friend lists while your account is deactivated. And a
        second that explains that certain logs are needed to provide you
        with service during the lifetime of your account and therefore
        are deleted only after you delete your account.


Section II. Sharing and finding you on Facebook

This section is designed to help you understand how you can use your
privacy settings to control the information you share on Facebook and
how people can find you. We have updated the policy in the following
ways:


      * Control each time you post. We=92ve added a tip to be sure you
        know that someone may deduce information about you even if you
        don=92t share it. For example, we note that people might guess it
        is your birthday because your friends have posted birthday
        wishes on your timeline. You have the ability to delete or hide
        these posts from your timeline if you wish. We also added some
        language to illustrate our existing statement that, when you
        make a comment on someone else=92s post, that person =96 not you =
=96
        gets to select the audience.
      * Control over your timeline. The new tip in this section
        clarifies that, even if you restrict who can see your entire
        list of friends, when someone visits your timeline, they may be
        able to see some of the mutual friends you have in common.
        That=92s because some of those mutual friends have set a different
        audience for their list than you have.
      * Finding you on Facebook. We=92ve included more detail about how
        people can find you on Facebook. You can use your privacy
        settings to control whether someone can see your contact
        information (such as your email and telephone number) on your
        timeline. In addition, we offer a separate setting to control
        whether people can search for you using that contact
        information. This is because you might want people who know your
        contact information to find you but you might not want to show
        your contact information to people who don=92t already have it. We
        also explain that neither of these settings impacts whether
        someone can find your timeline when they search for content that
        they have permission to see.
      * Access on phones and other devices. Since more people than ever
        are using Facebook on their mobile phones, we thought it was
        important to add more information about how Facebook works on
        mobile devices. As part of mobile integrations, other users may
        sync or save information you=92ve shared with them to their mobile
        devices =96 such as contact information or event information from
        a calendar invite. We have included a tip to remind you that you
        should only share information with people you trust because they
        may be able to store or re-share that information, including by
        syncing it with a mobile device.
      * Activity log. With the launch of timeline, we also launched an
        exciting new control tool, Activity Log, which gives you one
        place to see the things you=92ve posted to Facebook. From your
        Activity Log, you can change the visibility of your posts or
        control whether they show up in your timeline. Only you can see
        your Activity Log.
      * Links and Tags. We added new language in this section to explain
        further how tags function. Simple URL references to someone=92s
        Facebook timeline are links, not tags. Tags are a special type
        of link that add you and your friends to the audience of the
        post and add content to your timeline. You can choose whether
        the story you=92ve been tagged in appears on your timeline and
        which audience sees it through the many tools Facebook provides
        to control tagging. For example in your privacy settings you can
        turn on timeline review, which allows you to review posts and
        photos you're tagged in before they go on your timeline.
      * Groups. The new language clarifies how you can join Groups and
        be added to subgroups. It reflects our launch of Groups for
        Schools, which are special groups that are only open to people
        who have a confirmed email address for a particular school. For
        example, you can join the University of Florida group if you go
        to school there and have a confirmed @ufl.edu email address.
        Groups for Schools have subgroups within them =96 for instance, a
        subgroup for your English class. If you=92re in the University of
        Florida group, then anyone in that group (even if they aren=92t
        your friend on Facebook) can invite you to a University of
        Florida subgroup.
      * About Pages. We=92ve added a tip to this section to make sure you
        know that Page administrators receive aggregate information on
        how their customers or fans are interacting with their Pages. In
        addition, similar to timeline, Page administrators may know
        you=92ve made a connection to their Page if you =93like=94 their Pa=
ge
        or post a comment.


Section III. Other websites and applications

This section provides information about features like social plugins and
the ways in which your information is shared with applications and
websites you and your friends use. We have updated the policy in the
following ways:


      * Controlling what information you share with applications. We=92ve
        added language here to clarify the type of information apps
        receive when you install them. We describe the limited
        categories of information that Facebook tells apps when you
        first visit them. If an app wants additional information, they
        must get your permission. If you do this, the app can access,
        store and update that information. Once you haven=92t used the app
        for a while, however, that app won=92t be able to continue
        updating this additional information until you give it
        permission again. In addition, we=92ve added a tip to remind you
        that apps have their own policies around how they handle the
        data they receive and that you should contact an app directly if
        you want your information deleted.
      * Controlling what is shared when the people you share with use
        applications. You can use the =93Apps and Websites=94 privacy
        setting to control the information others share about you with
        the apps they use, except for public information about you or
        your list of friends.
      * Logging in to another site using Facebook. Through Facebook
        Platform you can log into other applications and websites using
        your Facebook account. We added language to this section to
        remind you that we provide the site with your User ID when you
        login, just like when you connect with any other application. In
        addition, we have clarified that we use a technology called
        "hashing" that is designed to protect your email address when
        you use Facebook to login to another website. This technology
        offers a similar level of protection to encryption. We scramble
        your email address and then instruct the other website to
        scramble it in the same way. If the scrambled versions match, we
        can identify your account without needing to send your email
        address to the other website.
      * About social plugins. Social plugins are tools that other
        websites can use to provide you with personalized and social
        experiences. When you interact with social plugins, you can
        share your experiences off Facebook with your friends and others
        on Facebook. We have launched new social plugins since we last
        updated the Data Use Policy, so we want to provide you with
        additional information on how plugins operate. We have not
        changed the information we collect through plugins or our policy
        about how we use that information. For more information, see our
        Help Center
        (https://www.facebook.com/help/social-plugin-privacy).
      * About instant personalization. We=92ve added language to explain
        that, in addition to websites, apps may also use instant
        personalization (including those on Pages on Facebook).


Section IV. How Advertising and Sponsored Stories work

These sections explain how we serve you ads and sponsored stories and
our use of cookies. We have updated the policy in the following ways:


      * Personalized ads. We=92re providing more details about how we
        serve you personalized ads, including the information we use to
        serve you ads and make them more relevant to you. We use
        cookies, pixels or similar technologies to measure and
        understand the performance of our ads, to serve other ads and to
        generally make our ads more effective. We want to be sure you
        understand how cookies work, so we have added more information
        about them in the Data Use Policy and added a link to our Help
        Center (https://www.facebook.com/help/?page=3D176591669064814).
        We=92re also clarifying our existing disclosure that we might show
        ads off Facebook to explain that, if we showed these ads, they
        may or may not include social context (such as whether your
        friends have =93liked=94 a particular business).
      * Ads and social context, Sponsored stories and Facebook content.
        We added tips into these sections to clarify that your =93Show my
        social actions in Facebook Ads=94 setting only controls ads with
        social context. This setting doesn=92t impact Sponsored Stories,
        which are different from Facebook ads.


Section V. Cookies, pixels, and other system technologies

We are moving the section on Minors and Safety to Section VI. We have
not made any changes to the content of this section.

We=92ve moved up and added to the section on Cookies. The new proposed
Section V is calledCookies, pixels, and other system technologies. Since
cookies are a very commonly used technology, we want to provide you with
more detail on how Facebook uses cookies and similar technologies. We
also include a tip in this section reminding you that you can remove or
block cookies and similar technologies.

Section VI. Some other things you need to know


      * Safe harbor. As part of our participation in the Safe Harbor
        program, we added contact information for TRUSTe, a global
        privacy management solutions provider through which we agree to
        resolve any disputes.
      * Contact us with questions or disputes. We added contact info for
        questions or complaints about the Data Use Policy.
      * Responding to legal requests and preventing harm. The new
        language in this section further explains the legal obligations
        and other circumstances in which we may access, preserve or
        share your information in a way that is different from how we
        normally handle it.
      * Access requests. This section reflects our belief that you
        should have access to your personal data on Facebook. We=92ve
        updated this language to reflect a recently launched expansion
        to Download Your Information, a tool that allows you access to
        an expanded archive of your Facebook account history.
      * Memorializing accounts. The revisions to this section reflect
        new features like timeline and the fact that requests to access
        or close a deceased person=92s Facebook account are subject to
        legal or procedural requirements.
      * Service Providers. Like other companies, we sometimes use
        outside service providers to help improve the services we offer,
        such as by processing payments. We=92ve added language to this
        section to elaborate on how we use service providers.
      * Security and bugs. We have systems in place that attempt to keep
        Facebook operating bug-free and safe. Additionally, we have a
        White Hat Bug Bounty Program where people can responsibly
        disclose bugs on our site so that they can be escalated for
        immediate review. The new language in this section is a reminder
        that no system is perfect.
      * Information for users outside the United States and Canada. We
        added contact information for our international headquarters,
        Facebook Ireland Limited, which provides services to users
        outside the U.S. and Canada.
      * Your California Privacy Rights. We added this section as another
        way for California residents to get information on how to
        contact us.=20

<BR>
We want to make sure you understand the proposed updates to the Data Use Po=
licy so we have included descriptions of the changes by section. While we&#=
8217;ve provided a lot of information below, the vast majority of the propo=
sed changes represent additional explanations of current practices rather t=
han substantive changes in how we use your data. We are proposing three mai=
n categories of changes to our Data Use Policy: (1)&nbsp;<B>examples and ex=
planations&nbsp;</B>to enhance the descriptions of our policies<B>,&nbsp;</=
B>many of which were based on recommendations from the Irish Data Protectio=
n Commissioner&#8217;s Office, the regulatory oversight agency for our serv=
ices outside the U.S. and Canada; (2) new language to explain our policies =
around&nbsp;<B>new features</B>&nbsp;we&#8217;ve launched or updated since =
we last revised our Data Use Policy; and (3)&nbsp;<B>administrative and org=
anizational</B>&nbsp;changes.<BR>
<BR>
<B>&nbsp;</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>General</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>&nbsp;</B><BR>
<BR>
Since the last revision to our Data Use Policy, we launched Facebook Timeli=
ne. Therefore, we&#8217;re changing &#8220;profile&#8221; to &#8220;timelin=
e&#8221; and &#8220;post&#8221; to &#8220;story&#8221; throughout the Data =
Use Policy and including references to features, like cover photos, that wo=
rk with timeline.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
In addition, there were a few places where the Data Use Policy was duplicat=
ive or where items would be more relevant in other sections. To address tho=
se organizational issues, we consolidated a few discussions into the sectio=
ns where we thought they made the most sense.<B>&nbsp;</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>&nbsp;</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Section I. Information we receive and how it is used&nbsp;</B><BR>
<BR>
This section explains the type of information we receive and how we use tha=
t information. We have updated the policy in the following ways:<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
    <LI><I>Your information</I><B>&nbsp;</B>and&nbsp;<I>Information that is=
 always publicly available</I>. In these sections, we&#8217;ve stated the k=
inds of information about you that are always public. For instance, your ge=
nder is public information, and we use your gender throughout the site to r=
efer to you properly. And, as we&#8217;ve explained throughout the Data Use=
 Policy, your gender is shared with apps so they can refer to you properly =
as well. You will still be able to hide your gender on your timeline. In ad=
dition, cover photos are a new part of the Facebook experience, and we&#821=
7;re updating the Data Use Policy to let you know that, just like your prof=
ile pictures, your cover photos are public. If you&#8217;re uncomfortable w=
ith making your profile pictures or cover photos public, you can always del=
ete them.
    <LI><I>Information others share about you.&nbsp;</I>We&#8217;ve added s=
ome language to clarify how others may share information about you (for exa=
mple, posting a picture of you or by uploading your contact information). I=
n addition<I>,&nbsp;</I>we consolidated some language in this section about=
 apps into the section entitled&nbsp;<I>Controlling what information you sh=
are with applications</I>.
    <LI><I>Other information we receive about you.</I><B>&nbsp;</B>We&#8217=
;ve provided additional descriptions around the ways we receive information=
 about you when you interact with Facebook and how that information may be =
used. For example, we&#8217;ve added clarifications about the types of data=
 we receive about you when you use our mobile app. In addition, we have rep=
laced the specific reference to data retention around advertisers with an o=
verall data retention commitment, which is described below in&nbsp;<I>How w=
e use the information we receive.</I>
    <LI><I>Usernames and User IDs</I>. The clarifications in this section p=
rovide further information about your Username and User ID, including that =
we will assign usernames and Facebook email addresses to your Facebook acco=
unt if you have not selected them already. This makes it easier for you to =
tell friends how to find your timeline and for you to email people off Face=
book.
    <LI><I>How we use the information we receive</I>. We receive informatio=
n about you through your interaction with Facebook. In this section we&#821=
7;re providing more examples of the ways we may use that data to continue t=
o provide you with the best features and services possible. For example, we=
 may use this data to deliver ads that are more relevant to you. We&#8217;v=
e also included a reminder that when others share information about you, th=
ey control how that information is shared.
</UL>
<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
In addition, we&#8217;ve added new language that explains our overall commi=
tment around data retention: we will retain data for as long as necessary t=
o provide services to users and others. This broader commitment applies to =
all data we collect and receive about you, including information from adver=
tisers. With respect to advertisers, those relationships are evolving becau=
se of the different services we provide. We will continue to retain data re=
ceived from advertisers for 180 days where that length of time is necessary=
 to provide services. But there may be some times when we will need to keep=
 information that we get from an advertiser for longer than 180 days. For e=
xample, if an advertiser creates a Facebook Page, we wouldn't delete inform=
ation the advertiser puts on its page simply because 180 days had passed. I=
nstead, we would delete it when it was no longer needed &#8212; when the pa=
ge owner deleted it or closed its account. The revisions in this section do=
 not change our commitment that we won't share information that personally =
identifies you with advertisers without your permission.<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
    <LI><I>Deleting and deactivating your account</I>. We added tips to the=
se two sections. One that clarifies that friends will see you in their frie=
nd lists while your account is deactivated. And a second that explains that=
 certain logs are needed to provide you with service during the lifetime of=
 your account and therefore are deleted only after you delete your account.
</UL>
<BR>
<B>Section II. Sharing and finding you on Facebook</B><BR>
<BR>
This section is designed to help you understand how you can use your privac=
y settings to control the information you share on Facebook and how people =
can find you. We have updated the policy in the following ways:<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
    <LI><I>Control each time you post</I>. We&#8217;ve added a tip to be su=
re you know that someone may deduce information about you even if you don&#=
8217;t share it. For example, we note that people might guess it is your bi=
rthday because your friends have posted birthday wishes on your timeline. Y=
ou have the ability to delete or hide these posts from your timeline if you=
 wish. We also added some language to illustrate our existing statement tha=
t, when you make a comment on someone else&#8217;s post, that person &#8211=
; not you &#8211; gets to select the audience.
    <LI><I>Control over your timeline</I>. The new tip in this section clar=
ifies that, even if you restrict who can see your entire list of friends, w=
hen someone visits your timeline, they may be able to see some of the mutua=
l friends you have in common. That&#8217;s because some of those mutual fri=
ends have set a different audience for their list than you have.
    <LI><I>Finding you on Facebook</I>. We&#8217;ve included more detail ab=
out how people can find you on Facebook. You can use your privacy settings =
to control whether someone can see your contact information (such as your e=
mail and telephone number) on your timeline. In addition, we offer a separa=
te setting to control whether people can search for you using that contact =
information. This is because you might want people who know your contact in=
formation to find you but you might not want to show your contact informati=
on to people who don&#8217;t already have it. We also explain that neither =
of these settings impacts whether someone can find your timeline when they =
search for content that they have permission to see.
    <LI><I>Access on phones and other devices.</I>&nbsp;Since more people t=
han ever are using Facebook on their mobile phones, we thought it was impor=
tant to add more information about how Facebook works on mobile devices. As=
 part of mobile integrations, other users may sync or save information you&=
#8217;ve shared with them to their mobile devices &#8211; such as contact i=
nformation or event information from a calendar invite. We have included a =
tip to remind you that you should only share information with people you tr=
ust because they may be able to store or re-share that information, includi=
ng by syncing it with a mobile device.
    <LI><I>Activity log</I>. With the launch of timeline, we also launched =
an exciting new control tool, Activity Log, which gives you one place to se=
e the things you&#8217;ve posted to Facebook. From your Activity Log, you c=
an change the visibility of your posts or control whether they show up in y=
our timeline. Only you can see your Activity Log.
    <LI><I>Links and Tags</I>. We added new language in this section to exp=
lain further how tags function. Simple URL references to someone&#8217;s Fa=
cebook timeline are links, not tags. Tags are a special type of link that a=
dd you and your friends to the audience of the post and add content to your=
 timeline. You can choose whether the story you&#8217;ve been tagged in app=
ears on your timeline and which audience sees it through the many tools Fac=
ebook provides to control tagging. For example in your privacy settings you=
 can turn on timeline review, which allows you&nbsp;to review posts and pho=
tos you're tagged in before they go on your timeline.
    <LI><I>Groups</I>. The new language clarifies how you can join Groups a=
nd be added to subgroups. It reflects our launch of Groups for Schools, whi=
ch are special groups that are only open to people who have a confirmed ema=
il address for a particular school. For example, you can join the Universit=
y of Florida group if you go to school there and have a confirmed @ufl.edu =
email address. Groups for Schools have subgroups within them &#8211; for in=
stance, a subgroup for your English class. If you&#8217;re in the Universit=
y of Florida group, then anyone in that group (even if they aren&#8217;t yo=
ur friend on Facebook) can invite you to a University of Florida subgroup.
    <LI><I>About Pages</I>. We&#8217;ve added a tip to this section to make=
 sure you know that Page administrators receive aggregate information on ho=
w their customers or fans are interacting with their Pages. In addition, si=
milar to timeline, Page administrators may know you&#8217;ve made a connect=
ion to their Page if you &#8220;like&#8221; their Page or post a comment.
</UL>
<BR>
<B>Section III. Other websites and applications</B><BR>
<BR>
This section provides information about features like social plugins and th=
e ways in which your information is shared with applications and websites y=
ou and your friends use. We have updated the policy in the following ways:<=
BR>
<BR>
<UL>
    <LI><I>Controlling what information you share with applications</I>. We=
&#8217;ve added language here to clarify the type of information apps recei=
ve when you install them. We describe the limited categories of information=
 that Facebook tells apps when you first visit them. If an app wants additi=
onal information, they must get your permission. If you do this, the app ca=
n access, store and update that information. Once you haven&#8217;t used th=
e app for a while, however, that app won&#8217;t be able to continue updati=
ng this additional information until you give it permission again. In addit=
ion, we&#8217;ve added a tip to remind you that apps have their own policie=
s around how they handle the data they receive and that you should contact =
an app directly if you want your information deleted.
    <LI><I>Controlling what is shared when the people you share with use ap=
plications</I>. You can use the &#8220;Apps and Websites&#8221; privacy set=
ting to control the information others share about you with the apps they u=
se, except for public information about you or your list of friends.
    <LI><I>Logging in to another site using Facebook.&nbsp;</I>Through Face=
book Platform you can log into other applications and websites using your F=
acebook account. We added language to this section to remind you that we pr=
ovide the site with your User ID when you login, just like when you connect=
 with any other application. In addition, we have clarified that we use a t=
echnology called &quot;hashing&quot; that is designed to protect your email=
 address when you use Facebook to login to another website. This technology=
 offers a similar level of protection to encryption. We scramble your email=
 address and then instruct the other website to scramble it in the same way=
.&nbsp;If the scrambled versions match, we can identify your account withou=
t needing to send your email address to the other website.
    <LI><I>About social plugins</I>. Social plugins are tools that other we=
bsites can use to provide you with personalized and social experiences. Whe=
n you interact with social plugins, you can share your experiences off Face=
book with your friends and others on Facebook. We have launched new social =
plugins since we last updated the Data Use Policy, so we want to provide yo=
u with additional information on how plugins operate. We have not changed t=
he information we collect through plugins or our policy about how we use th=
at information. For more information, see our Help Center (https://www.face=
book.com/help/social-plugin-privacy).
    <LI><I>About instant personalization</I>. We&#8217;ve added language to=
 explain that, in addition to websites, apps may also use instant personali=
zation (including those on Pages on Facebook).
</UL>
<BR>
<B>Section IV. How Advertising and Sponsored Stories work</B><BR>
<BR>
These sections explain how we serve you ads and sponsored stories and our u=
se of cookies. We have updated the policy in the following ways:<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
    <LI><I>Personalized ads</I>. We&#8217;re providing more details about h=
ow we serve you personalized ads, including the information we use to serve=
 you ads and make them more relevant to you. We use cookies, pixels or simi=
lar technologies to measure and understand the performance of our ads, to s=
erve other ads and to generally make our ads more effective. We want to be =
sure you understand how cookies work, so we have added more information abo=
ut them in the Data Use Policy and added a link to our Help Center (https:/=
/www.facebook.com/help/?page=3D176591669064814). We&#8217;re also clarifyin=
g our existing disclosure that we might show ads off Facebook to explain th=
at, if we showed these ads, they may or may not include social context (suc=
h as whether your friends have &#8220;liked&#8221; a particular business).
    <LI><I>Ads and social context, Sponsored stories</I>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<I>F=
acebook content</I>. We added tips into these sections to clarify that your=
 &#8220;Show my social actions in Facebook Ads&#8221; setting only controls=
 ads with social context. This setting doesn&#8217;t impact Sponsored Stori=
es, which are different from Facebook ads.
</UL>
<BR>
<B>Section V. Cookies, pixels, and other system technologies</B><BR>
<BR>
We are moving the section on&nbsp;<I>Minors and Safety</I>&nbsp;to Section =
VI. We have not made any changes to the content of this section.<BR>
<BR>
We&#8217;ve moved up and added to the section on&nbsp;<I>Cookies</I>. The n=
ew proposed Section V is called<I>Cookies, pixels, and other system technol=
ogies.&nbsp;</I>Since cookies are a very commonly used technology, we want =
to provide you with more detail on how Facebook uses cookies and similar te=
chnologies. We also include a tip in this section reminding you that you ca=
n remove or block cookies and similar technologies.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Section VI. Some other things you need to know</B><BR>
<BR>
<UL>
    <LI><I>Safe harbor</I>. As part of our participation in the Safe Harbor=
 program, we added contact information for TRUSTe, a global privacy managem=
ent solutions provider through which we agree to resolve any disputes.
    <LI><I>Contact us with questions or disputes</I>. We added contact info=
 for questions or complaints about the Data Use Policy.
    <LI><I>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm</I>. The new la=
nguage in this section further explains the legal obligations and other cir=
cumstances in which we may access, preserve or share your information in a =
way that is different from how we normally handle it.
    <LI><I>Access requests</I>. This section reflects our belief that you s=
hould have access to your personal data on Facebook. We&#8217;ve updated th=
is language to reflect a recently launched expansion to Download Your Infor=
mation, a tool that allows you access to an&nbsp;expanded archive of your F=
acebook account history.
    <LI><I>Memorializing accounts</I>. The revisions to this section reflec=
t new features like timeline and the fact that requests to access or close =
a deceased person&#8217;s Facebook account are subject to legal or procedur=
al requirements.
    <LI><I>Service Providers</I>. Like other companies, we sometimes use ou=
tside service providers to help improve the services we offer, such as by p=
rocessing payments. We&#8217;ve added language to this section to elaborate=
 on how we use service providers.
    <LI><I>Security and bugs</I>.<B>&nbsp;</B>We have&nbsp;systems&nbsp;in =
place&nbsp;that attempt&nbsp;to keep Facebook operating bug-free and safe. =
Additionally, we have a White Hat Bug Bounty Program where people can respo=
nsibly disclose bugs on our site so that they can be escalated for immediat=
e review. The new language in this section is a reminder that no system is =
perfect.
    <LI><I>Information for users outside the United States and Canada</I>. =
We added contact information for our international headquarters, Facebook I=
reland Limited, which provides services to users outside the U.S. and Canad=
a.
    <LI><I>Your California Privacy Rights</I>. We added this section as ano=
ther way for California residents to get information on how to contact us.&=
