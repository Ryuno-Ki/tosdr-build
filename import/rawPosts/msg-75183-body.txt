Unless it is obviously so bad that it violates the law plainly (in that
case I think it's fair to assume it's probably Class E ToS) I think it's
unlikely that we'll have to deal with that kind of aspect.

The most obvious reason for this is that it is very difficult to
estimate whether it violates the law or not (that's why we have judges
and trials after all!). So I'd stick to analysing the terms as they are
given and take them from the user point of view to qualify whether the
terms are balanced and fair.

The second reason is that the law is different in almost every country
so it would be impossible for us to scale up to that point right now.
And obviously, how do you treat differences in law from US, EU or=85
China? :)

Does that work for you? what do you think?
