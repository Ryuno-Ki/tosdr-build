It is quite impressive how much information you can find in plain text
on facebook pages, if you know where to look.  Maybe I should just map
the facebook maze^W website.

https://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=3D186325668085084#What-information-does-=
Facebook-get-about-me-when-I-visit-a-website-with-a-Facebook-social-plug-in=
?
        since the Like button is a little piece of Facebook embedded on
        another website, the browser is sending information about the
        request to load Facebook content on that page. We record some of
        this information for a limited amount of time
TODO: what's that limited amount of time? (see below I assume)
        when you go to a website with a Like button, we need to know who
        you are [=85]  The data we receive includes your user ID, the
        website you're visiting, the date and time, and other
        browser-related information.=20
       =20
        If you=92re logged out or don=92t have a Facebook account and visit
        a website with the Like button or another social plugin, [=85] We
        do receive the web page you're visiting, the date and time, and
        other browser-related information. We record this information
        for a limited amount of time [=85] we sometimes find bugs in the
        systems we=92ve built to gather aggregate data on how people are
        interacting with sites that use the Like button or other social
        plugins. It=92s helpful to be able to reference this anonymized
        information when investigating these bugs so we can find their
        source and fix them quickly.
       =20
"anonymized information"???? WTH. They have "browser-related
information" although they don't have the facebook user id. Is that
really anonymity? what's browser-related information? is a cookie
browser-related?

Fortunately the last part gives us some guarantee; but I'd be more
confident if they were in the terms rather than an help page=85

        we do not use the information we receive when you visit a site
        with the =93Like=94 button or another social plugin to create a
        profile of your browsing behavior on third-party sites or to
        show you ads, although we may use anonymous or aggregate data to
        improve ads generally. We delete or anonymize the information we
        receive within 90 days, and we don't sell it to advertisers or
        share it without your permission.
       =20
Now. That's an interesting question: they say they "delete or anonymize"
which supposes that the information is previously not anonymous -- I
suppose that refers to information recorded on users logged-in.

So as I understand, that means that for information gathered on users
who are logged-in, Facebook keeps the information  forever (except the
user-id). That information includes "the web page you're visiting, the
date and time, and other browser-related information".

TODO: facebook states they don't sell or share it unless they have "your
permission". I wonder where that permission comes from: is there a
privacy setting somewhere for this?=20
