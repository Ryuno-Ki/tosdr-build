Hi there,

actually, it's possible to delete a Skype account, at least if you're a
german customer. It's definitely not easy to find out how to, but when
you know it's as simple as this. What I did:

- Write an e-mail to contactus@skype.net, tell them you want to delete
your account

- You'll get a reply asking you some questions in order to prove your
identity (i.e. two telephone numbers you recently called, the date and
sum of your last purchase, the payment method you used, the e-mail
address you used when you first registered with Skype).

- After identifying yourself you'll get a confirmation like this:
"We can confirm that your Skype account has now been canceled in
accordance with your recent request. This is effective immediately and
the time period for removing your Skype Name from the search directory
is usually short, however, sometimes it may take up to two weeks. This
is a technical delay, which is out of Skype=92s control."

Hurrah! (Caveat: it's possible that this procedure only works for german
customers).

Thanks for your awfull website!

Juergen
