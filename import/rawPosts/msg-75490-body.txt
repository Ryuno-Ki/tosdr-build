------=_Part_1165_23750839.1339608167658
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

So the point was added to
https://github.com/unhosted/ToS-DR/blob/master/points/g4RWiArs104.json

{
	"id": "g4RWiArs104",
	"name": "No Tracking",
	"category": "Anonymity",
	"discussion": "https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/tosdr/g4RWiArs104",
	"source": "http://donttrack.us/",
	"service": "ddg",
	"point": "good",
	"score": "100",
	"tldr": "DuckDuckGo doesn't save your searches and doesn't send your searches to other sites. No personal information is saved either. "
}


So Michiel and I have assigned to this point the top score 100 which means 
that this point matters a lot. 
Since there are basically no other points raising concerns after having 
read DDG's privacy policy https://duckduckgo.com/privacy.html I decided to 
start the process to assign a class to the whole service. With "+100" on 
average, it gets a Class A. The website http://tos-dr.info has been updated 
accordingly.

Does anyone has other opinions, suggestions? Maybe we could add positive 
points for the great care they take documenting the changes in the privacy 
policy.

Best,
Hugo
