yes! good point. in the footer of http://tos-dr.info/ we mention both
Privacy Icons and tosback as the "shoulders" ToS;DR stands on.

We also talked to Dan from Tosback and Aza from Privacy Icons about
our plans to start this new project.

The main difference between Tosback and ToS;DR is, i would say,
Tosback only records changes, and doesn't tell the user if they are
good or bad. FWIW, we're going to restart Tosback.org's cronjob
(although tosback.ie is still running, the .org instance has stopped
updating almost a year ago).

The main difference between Privacy Icons (and also Standard
Information Sharing Label
http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joeandrieu/a-standard-information-sharing-label
) and ToS;DR is in actually saying "On the whole, this is a class X".
Where X ranges from A to G or similar, like in the washing machine
energy label http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Energy_label_en.svg

Having said that, i think i saw some actual data about actual sites
when Privacy Icons was on Drumbeat, we should try to recover that so
that we can factor it in. i'll reply to this thread when i find it.
