oh cool, we should definitely work together! how can we integrate
CommonTerms and ToS;DR? i think there's a space inbetween your
standardization efforts and our classification efforts, and that is
data collection. as far as i understood from
http://commonterms.net/Solution.aspx you allow websites to fill in
their own preview data, right? Suppose for a moment that e.g. facebook
does not do this. can we then crowd-read their ToS and fill in the
preview for them? Will CommonTerms provide a wiki for such data
collection?

we can at least use your icons for what we now call the 'categories'
on our website.

also http://commonterms.net/Related.aspx is a great resource, i
especially enjoyed finding this one:
