For reference, this is what Jan and I talked about in December. I
still think the 'location of court of law' one is not something you
can call globally good or bad about a service - but maybe we can add
'a large percentage of users will be able to use the service under the
law system of the country where they (habitually) live'? i guess all
law systems have good and bad aspects, but i know a lot of Europeans
trust their own country's law system, or that of other European
countries, more than the US law system. that's the reason this point
is on there. but it's a difficult one to implement, i guess.

My thoughts on criteria (maybe merging):

1) (basically revised this one, data liberation has enough weight)
Ownership & Data liberation (not sure, but data liberation as it is
has not enough weight on its own)
2) Equality & Anonymity (because the case for separating it is
specifically Dropbox =96 rephrase to =BBservice is blind to location, real
name, =85=AB =96 =BBpolitical views=AB are also problematic because that=92=
s not a
matter of freedom of speech (see Swastika in Germany))
3) Third Parties (advertising) & Law enforcement (both essentially
=BBgiving stuff away to third parties=AB)
4) Location of court of law (not sure, maybe merge with EEA?)

The 2 new ones:
1) this service is exploited by a for-profit company / is not ...
2) there is a contact person for questions and complaints about this
service / there is none
don=92t warrant 2 whole new criteria in my eyes. Especially the
for-/non-profit one. Maybe if we rephrase or merge, but just binary
=BBnon-profit=AB or =BBfor-profit=AB is too short sighted. Giving data away=
 to
advertisers for instance would be exclusive to for-profits, wouldn=92t
it?

Also a bit of devil=92s advocate =96 on the discussion page we should also
say why we included the criteria and why in this form.

Just to mention it, another approach from the =BBbig but few criteria=AB
would be =BBmany but just binary criteria=AB. That would leave us with,
say, 50 criteria though (30 at least) and would be very non-accurate
(say, data liberation would not be expressed with a simple binary
choice as it doesn=92t account for open formats, usability between
services, importing etc. =96 and if it does, it would be a very
black/white choice.)
