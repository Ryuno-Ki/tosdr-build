To continue on the thread about copyright licenses
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/tosdr/kizrN7qb1Ck
(please answer to that post if you have further opinion about the
general topic)

Let's now focus on Twitter terms. https://twitter.com/tos

TL;DR:=20
     1. [mediocre] Ownership: The copyright license is very broad and
        goes beyond the requirements to run the service,
     2. [mediocre] Third-parties: Your data can be shared with Twitter's
        partners and other third-parties, on Twitter's terms =96 not
        yours.

The copyright license in Twitter terms is, as I wrote earlier, very
broad:
        You retain your rights to any Content you submit, post or
        display on or through the Services. By submitting, posting or
        displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant us a
        worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right
        to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify,
        publish, transmit, display and distribute such Content in any
        and all media or distribution methods (now known or later
        developed).
       =20
        [Tip This license is you authorizing us to make your Tweets
        available to the rest of the world and to let others do the
        same.]
       =20
That seems reasonable, but is it? The "Tip" is very optimistic. The
license isn't just about the rights "to display to the world" but is
indeed much larger.

I would say that the most worrying aspect of this license is that there
are absolutely no limitations to this license. By limitations, I mean
something like SeenThis (Twitter competitor) "autorisations permettant
le bon fonctionnement du syst=E8me" or Dropbox's "These Terms do not grant
us any rights to your stuff or intellectual property except for the
limited rights that are needed to run the Services". Dropbox also
documents in their privacy policy why exactly and with whom information
is shared.

Moreover if you look at how Twitter handled copyright prior to their
September 2009 changes, you get a very different picture. Here's what we
had before:
        Copyright (What=92s Yours is Yours)
       =20
            We claim no intellectual property rights over the material
        you provide to the Twitter service. Your profile and materials
        uploaded remain yours. [...]
            We encourage users to contribute their creations to the
        public domain or consider progressive licensing terms.
       =20
I believe it's possible that this former policy may encounter problems.
However I am not convinced that the current solution is in the best
interest of the users. With such a broad scope in the copyright license,
Twitter effectively becomes owner of the data (tweet, meta information
in the tweet, pictures tweeted; etc.) and can transfer or sublicense to
third parties. As acknowledges the current TOS:
       =20
        You agree that this license includes the right for Twitter to
        provide, promote, and improve the Services and to make Content
        submitted to or through the Services available to other
        companies, organizations or individuals who partner with Twitter
        for the syndication, broadcast, distribution or publication of
        such Content on other media and services, subject to our terms
        and conditions for such Content use.
       =20
        [Tip Twitter has an evolving set of rules for how ecosystem
        partners can interact with your Content. These rules exist to
        enable an open ecosystem with your rights in mind. But what=92s
        yours is yours =96 you own your Content (and your photos are part
        of that Content).]

To me, what's in the best interest of the user is a copyright license
chosen by the user, like for instance CC-BY or CC-BY-SA or CC-BY-NC or
CC-BY-ND, whatever the _user_ chooses. At least in these case it is
clear for users how their content is licensed.
