What would happen if Twitter decide to sell the collected Direct
Messages between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? I'm sure they could
make some good book sales with that :)

and IIUC, they already have the license to publish all our DMs?

on https://support.twitter.com/groups/31-twitter-basics/topics/109-tweets-m=
essages/articles/14606-what-is-a-direct-message-dm
it says direct messages are "private messages", but what would a judge
say if twitter were to publish such a book?
