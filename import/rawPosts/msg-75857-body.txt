This is a big difference with Facebook's equivalent "Social Plugins"
Not only the data is kept for 0day up to 17 days, but there's also an
opt-out mechanism!
https://twitter.com/privacy

        When these websites first load our buttons or widgets for
        display, we receive Log Data, including the web page you visited
        and a cookie that identifies your browser ("Widget Data"). After
        a maximum of 10 days, we start the process of deleting or
        aggregating Widget Data, which is usually instantaneous but in
        some cases may take up to a week. While we have the Widget Data,
        we may use it to tailor content for you, such as suggestions for
        people to follow on Twitter. Tailored content is stored with
        only your browser cookie ID and is separated from other Widget
        Data such as page-visit information. This feature is optional
        and not yet available to all users. If you want, you can suspend
        it or turn it off, which removes from your browser the unique
        cookie that enables the feature. Learn more about the feature
        here. For Tweets, Log Data, and other information that we
        receive from interactions with Twitter buttons or widgets,
        please see the other sections of this Privacy Policy.
        

To me, that's a very important aspect of the privacy policy, because it
indicates whether or not Twitter tracks you. With this, it is safe to
say that Twitter does minimum, acceptable tracking, especially since
they offer a way to opt-out. Kudos to Twitter for that. I'd give it a
lot of weight and I think it deserves to be on the website, especially
to offer a quick way for users to opt out.
