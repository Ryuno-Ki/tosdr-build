i think the only correct way to deal with account termination is to
make it seem like that account never existed. that may mean not only
removing the account itself, but also editing accounts of people the
user interacted with, to remove all those interactions.

at tuenti where i used to work, the profile would immediately become
invisible, and would then be deleted during the night (database
deletions are quite expensive on the server, so it's best to do them
when site traffic is low). the system deletes all content when a user
deletes or deactivates their account using 'lazy delete'. that means
the data is deleted the next time it's requested. put another way,
whenever data is retrieved from the database, there is a check whether
both the author-user and the subject-user of that bit of content still
exist. so with this system, content that you posted on your own
profile is deleted on the server within 24 hours, and content you
posted on other people's profiles is deleted on the server eventually.
In both cases it is deleted from the site (made invisible) within
seconds of the user clicking the 'delete my account' button.

i think facebook says you can delete your content, unless someone
already reshared it, so if you tag someone in a photo, and the photo
is added to their "photos i am tagged in" album, then you already have
lost your right to delete that photo. i guess that even happens when
they tag themselves in it.
