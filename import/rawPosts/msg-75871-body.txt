cookies are super important and evil. they're like the tracker chip
people get implanted in science fiction movies.

by default they do cookie you, though. i just tried it out, and if
you're not logged in, twitter cookies you, giving you a nice trackable
'guest_id'. if you log in you get _twitter_sess, and that seems to
stay after you log out (although i'm not sure whether i measured this
correctly).

nobody does that. what they should do is just not cookie you, except
to maintain session state, and also delete the cookie when you click
'logout'.

ok, so it's positive that they mention cookies, and inform users who
want to learn about cookies, but it doesn't seem to me they made any
efforts to use minimal cookies. so afaics, twitter cookie system is
bad, not good.
