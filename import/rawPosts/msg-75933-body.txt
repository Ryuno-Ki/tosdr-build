Right, I thought I mention it on the list already, but I guess this is
still in my draft notes about Facebook. Facebook says they delete your
content unless someone shared it. So your content will only be deleted
if every one else has deleted it.

IMO I'm not sure how to deal with account termination or how to rate
them. For instance, facebook's approach doesn't seem totally unfair to
me. After all, when I publish something, others also have a right to
comment or reshare my post. It's important for Free Speech, giving me
the right to completely take down something i've stated publicly at the
expense of others seem to me like censorship (and it's basically on of
the major problems behind the "right to be forgotten" proposals that we
see once in a while in Europe.)

From the terms, it's a bit hard to measure so I guess I'd need to dive
in more details about what it means in order to be able to clearly rate
that.

What do you think? Don't you think the Tuenti approach is a bit too
much?
