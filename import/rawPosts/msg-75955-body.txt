it depends what we define as deleting an account. to what extent is
content 'on your account' and to what extent is it 'out there'?

i guess the important point is that data that was not shared should be
deleted quickly. amazon ec2/s3 for instance say they will delete your
data, but if you log back in (i did so because i didn't trust it),
surprise! they still know all your details.

the rest (what is your data you can delete, and what has been reshared
and can't be censored anymore) is subject to bias of perception, i
guess.
