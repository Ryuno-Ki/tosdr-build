Yeah, we get to one of the core problems of "social networks" that is
people use them as merely instant communication channel, whereas they
are truly publication platforms, media. And that means what's published
is public. Removing something published just because the authors wishes
so is taking a way a right of the public.

On the other hand, all the data that's not public, should be deleted.
But I hardly think that Facebook deletes that data.

Twitter states they do after 30 days delete your account. But I have to
say I'm puzzled. What happens of Retweets for instance? Are they just
taken down?

Anyway, we're maybe going a bit beyond the scope of our topic here.
