I don't really understand your concern. We're talking about session
cookies. They are transparent about their use, they don't require them
and _cookies stay fully in control of the user._

The argument "nobody does that" is not relevant IMO. It is not Twitter's
role to educate people about technology. OTOH I don't know if that
argument holds scrutiny, "cookies" are quite a known technology. Even if
most users don't really understand it, they know it, they roughly know
what they do and they know they can turn them off in their browser.

I think our role here should not to give our opinion on cookies in
general, but on Twitter's use of cookies and how their terms reflect it.
To me, Twitter's ToS are good in that regard. It's worth mentioning it
(and by way of mentioning it, obviously we can point out to users that
they can turn them off themselves).
