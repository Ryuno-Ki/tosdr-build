Oh gosh. I wonder where some people find so much time to waste. Good
that you could keep the number accurate!=20

Hm. That's a tough question :^)

I suppose we could do a joint PR when ToSDR is somewhat ready :)

I will also give a talk about ToSDR in Berlin's Campus Party in August.
I think the biggestlie.com is a very good way to introduce the subject,
so I'll be showing the website to start with :)

Maybe we could also have a "fake" signup service where the "Sign Up"
button would get to the biggestlie.com -- just a 2ct idea
