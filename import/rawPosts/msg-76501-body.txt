I committed the point
https://github.com/unhosted/ToS-DR/commit/b798dada59fd1ac8881e961ca193d7228=
69bb94d

I decided to put together the two issues: the fact that Twitter can
change the ToS at any time when they see fit, without really involving
the user or anything (which is pretty standard and not very evil) ; with
the fact that Twitter did critical changes to the ToS in the past (Sept
2009) without involving users at all=B9 (please prove me wrong if you have
more context on this, but I haven't been able to find anything at the
time, and no,i don't consider that this
http://blog.twitter.com/2009/09/twitters-new-terms-of-service.html is
enough)

Do you think I went too far with the score?

1. except for an email, as they claim in the blogpost. But I can't find
any email of the sort in September 2009.
