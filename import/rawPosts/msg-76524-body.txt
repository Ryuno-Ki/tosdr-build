>         With this first topic, I'd like to gather some comparative
>         information and discuss what seems to be a fair balance between

>         public. Then we could try to categorize them and give them a
>         rating.

> The first thing to discuss obviously is the scope of the copyright

>       * some ToS don't grant a specifically large license to the
>         operator of the service but fall back on a copyright public
>         license e.g. creative commons=20
>       * some ToS require the ability to transfer, sublicense with others
>         (sometimes it is limited to the partners e.g. Twitter Partners)
