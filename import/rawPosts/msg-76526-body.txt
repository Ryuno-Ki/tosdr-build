Yeah, regardless of how it=92s called =96 when my friends import their
mail address books=B9 and then if I at a later point sign up to the
service and then get these friends recommended =96 how is that for
tracking?


=B9 by the way, if people are still prompted to put in their mail
address and corresponding password, this is super bad practice. Again,
not sure if relevant.
