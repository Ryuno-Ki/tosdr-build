Hello,

We have 3 data points for SeenThis. The Terms are actually simple and
consist of a single page called "Intellectual Property" which is found
in the bottom of nearly every page.

The copyright license is limited to what's strictly necessary to run the
service.

The user has full choice over the copyright license under which their
messages are published (Public Domain, CC-*-NC, CC-*, or =A9) but public
domain or progressive licensing terms are encouraged.

Exportable.

Right to leave the service (needs you to contact them though).

No "privacy policy". They use cookies when you log in, or to give you a
"language id" to show you the website in French or English (possibly
other languages).

Except for the last point, which is accessory IMHO considering the low
level of intrusion of such cookies, everything seems perfect to me.

So I'd give to this Twitter's competitor a class A.
