Hm. I am not sure I want to get into a specific discussion about Do Not
Track itself.  Actually the problem with this standard, is that it is
hard to keep track of the changes in definitions, etc. Well, that's
ironic. So if somebody has a clearer picture than I have, please correct
me on the following:
      * The Do Not Track standard is about data use, not about data
        collection (this is confirmed in the US Congressmen's letter)
        see
        http://blog.hugoroy.eu/2012/02/23/la-fonction-ne-pas-me-pister-adop=
tee-et/
      * The data that is collected on a user that enabled Do Not Track
        can be used for certain things=85 but not targeted advertising,
        insurance or employement.
      * The standard says that by default DNT should NOT be enabled
        client side
              * Microsoft has recently annonced they will enable DNT by
                default
                      * So some services collecting data said that in
                        response to this breaching of the standard, they
                        will not respect DNT requests on their data use
      * We come back to the real problem of DNT: it is merely a request
        expressed by the user to the service collecting data not to do
        certain things when they use the data.
              * That's seems to me like an almost meaningless
                improvement - I prefer to have adblock filters that
                simply stop data collection at the root (see
                http://hugoroy.eu/tools/anti-tracking/ )
               =20
Please not however that Twitter says they will not collect data at all
if DNT is enabled. And for those who haven't enabled DNT, nor blocked
cookies, the tracking data is deleted in 10 days.

Also, they explain why they use the tracking data: Tailored
Suggestion.(see the links provided in the data point)

Am I missing something about DNT?
