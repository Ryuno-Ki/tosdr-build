        Member Content. Your Member Content is yours; AVOS does not
        claim any ownership rights in your Member Content. By posting,
        submitting or transmitting any Member Content on or through the
        Service, you grant us and our third party service providers and

        such Member Content in any and all media or distribution
        channels (now known or hereafter created).  For example, this
        license allows us to make your public "bookmarks" and comments

In France, I'm not even sure this copyright license is actually legal.

Just for reference, here's what the terms looked like one year ago
(courtesy of @Calimaq):
