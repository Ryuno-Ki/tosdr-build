        You may remove your Member Content from the Service at any time
        by specifically marking it for deletion or terminating your
        Account.  If you choose to remove your Member Content or to
        terminate your Account, your Member Content will be removed from
        our systems in a commercially reasonable amount time (e.g., time
        enough to allow our services to update), provided, however, we
        may retain an archived copy as required by law or for legitimate
        business purposes. In addition, in certain instances, copies of
        your Member Content may continue to exist in published or
        recorded form when it has been retransmitted, redistributed, or
        otherwise licensed to others as contemplated in these Terms. So,
        for example, if you remove a comment or a collection of
        bookmarks associated with your Account, such content may
        continue to appear in other places if someone makes a copy
        before you remove it from the Service. (e.g., as indexed by a
        search engine or a web archive).
