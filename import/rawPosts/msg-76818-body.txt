        License to Other Members. Subject to your compliance these
        Terms, AVOS grants you a limited license to access, share, tag
        and save to your Account any Member Content (including another
        Member's public "bookmarks") for your personal and
        non-commercial use, subject to the applicable Member's access
        settings for such content.  This license relates to the use of
        the Service and does not imply or represent that AVOS has any
        rights in the Member Content and AVOS does not purport to grant
        any rights in the Member Content. You may not use, copy,
        reproduce, adapt, modify, prepare derivative works based upon,
        distribute, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform,
        transmit or otherwise exploit the Service or Service Content,
        except as expressly permitted in these Terms. No licenses or
        rights are granted to you by implication or otherwise under any
        intellectual property rights owned or controlled by AVOS or its
        licensors, except for the licenses and rights expressly granted
        in these Terms. 
        

So to recap, delicious can do basically anything with all that you give
them, but in return you can do very little with the content provided by
other members. There's basically nothing in it for you, everything is
for delicious.

I have also asked them for an archive of the previous terms. So far I'm
impressed.
