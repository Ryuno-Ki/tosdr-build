yeah, cookies are evil. to be fair, iirc we gave points to twitter for
explicitly stating that you may disable cookies, and that some of the
functionality will still work, but maybe not everything.

'personalize the service for you' is a euphemism for profiling. allowing
third party cookies is really evil, but afaik, 49 out of the 50 biggest
websites do set cookies, and a lot of them set cookies for third-parties.
