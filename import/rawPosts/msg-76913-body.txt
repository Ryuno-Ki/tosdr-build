With exporting, having some random XML file or other dump is obviously
not enough. The service has to export it into a common format. For
contacts, that would be VCF, for events ICAL, for feeds OPML and so
on.

Just having your data in a technical file without knowing what to do
with it is a good start but not really worth much.
