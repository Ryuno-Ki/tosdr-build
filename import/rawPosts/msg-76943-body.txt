For now, you are right. But i think the significance of these export
buttons is changing.

both google and linkedin export contacts to vcard iirc. you can then
import them in other applications that accept vcards, like the "Meute"
app we are working on, or the addressbook app that usually comes with
your desktop OS or phone sync software.

both google and facebook export your photos to folders with jpegs
iirc. you can them import them in other photo applications like
OpenPhoto.

in addition, these services tend to offer APIs that allow other
services (like Locker Project) to create import buttons.

i think the reason we haven't really been able to use these export
buttons much is that one year ago, neither Meute nor OpenPhoto nor
Locker Project existed. I think we will see a lot of people exporting
their data from proprietary platforms and importing them into free
platforms during the coming year, and then the general opinion about
these export buttons will change. but we'll see. :)
