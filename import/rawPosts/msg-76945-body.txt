Reddit, reddit.com, pretty reasonable terms I=92d say, for being a
public community site. Not entirely sure how to rate the individual
points though.

First of all, you can use most of the site=92s functionality pretty much
without registration. Only for the obviously personal stuff like
commenting, upvoting, submitting.


Privacy Policy: http://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy

Collection: If you provide personally identifiable information, it
will be used to provide you with the service you have requested.

Third parties: We also allow access to our database by third parties
that provide us with services, such as technical maintenance or forums
and job search software, but only for the purpose of and to the extent
necessary to provide those services. [=85] While Service Provider will
seek to require such third parties to follow appropriate privacy
policies and will not authorize them to use this information except
for the express purpose for which it is provided, Service Provider
does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of third
parties.

Law: We may also provide access to our database in order to cooperate
with official investigations or legal proceedings, including, for
example, in response to subpoenas, search warrants, court orders, or
other legal process.

Cookies: We may use cookies to control the display of ads, to track
usage patterns on the site, to deliver editorial content, and to
record registration and personalization information. For example, if
you register on any part of the Website and are given the option to
save your user name and password on your computer, we can provide this
convenience to you by placing a cookie on your computer. Our cookies
may contain personally identifiable information and such cookies may
be shared with our affiliates and other companies.


User Agreement: http://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement

Content rights (makes sense for a public community forum, private
messages get used very rarely): Except as expressly provided otherwise
in the Privacy Policy, you agree that by posting messages, uploading
files, inputting data, or engaging in any other form of communication
with or through the Website, you grant us a royalty-free, perpetual,
non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide license to use, reproduce,
modify, adapt, translate, enhance, transmit, distribute, publicly
perform, display, or sublicense any such communication in any medium
(now in existence or hereinafter developed) and for any purpose,
including commercial purposes, and to authorize others to do so.

Ending service: Service Provider has the right to terminate and/or
suspend your ability to access the Website or any portion thereof, for
any or no reason, without notice. (haven=92t heard of any enforcement
really yet, especially not in unwarranted cases.)
