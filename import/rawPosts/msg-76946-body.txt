OwnCube, http://owncube.com

Location is good: =BBEuropean company: OwnCube is an Austrian company,
so our service is liable to Austrian legal norms. Our servers are
situated in Europe as well, and there is NO server that is situated in
the USA.=AB

The underlying software is ownCloud, http://owncloud.org, open source
under AGPLv3+, http://gitorious.org/owncloud/owncloud



Privacy Policy: https://owncube.com/#myModalss

=BBWe may collect personal identification information from Users in a
variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit our
site, register on the site, place an order, and in connection with
other activities, services, features or resources we make available on
our Site.=AB The =BBin a variety of ways=AB is unnecessarily broad, the nex=
t
sentence is more specific: =BBUsers may be asked for, as appropriate,
name, email address, phone number. We will collect personal
identification information from Users only if they voluntarily submit
such information to us.=AB
So I=92d say info collection is good / ok.

Good, personal data is not shared: =BBWe do not sell, trade, or rent
Users personal identification information to others. We may share
generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal
identification information regarding visitors and users with our
business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes
outlined above.=AB



Terms: https://owncube.com/#myModals

Only for the purpose of the service: =BBWe will collect and use of
personal information solely with the objective of fulfilling those
purposes specified by us and for other compatible purposes, unless we
obtain the consent of the individual concerned or as required by law.=AB

Data retention is good: =BBWe will only retain personal information as
long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes.=AB

Bad, pretty draconic terms regarding copyrighted files: =BBIf we get
abuse information concerning any files hosted on OwnCube, we will
inform the corresponding user about it and give him/her the
opportunity to remove the relevant data IMMEDIATELY. If the files are
not removed within ONE day, we claim the right to remove the user's
account.=AB
Removing the account completely is a bit over the top, as opposed to
just removing the files.
