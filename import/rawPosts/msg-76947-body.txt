I probably didn=92t express myself correctly. I think the significance
is already there and has been for a long time. Not only to import to
freedom services, but also simply to get bookmarks off delicious when
it=92s being sunsetted, and onto Pinboard or so. Or get stuff off Google
Reader onto Newsblur.

Basically, I just said: =BBEy, that seenthis.com allows XML export does
not mean much. What format, what other sites are there that accept
this format?=AB
