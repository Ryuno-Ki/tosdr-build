i just got prompted by facebook (during normal use) to 'read these
security tips' http://www.facebook.com/about/security?mp=2

I've seen several other websites do this (airbnb, wg-gesucht, tuenti,
ing bank, gmail), and for some services it's more relevant than for
others, but i think it's important from a consumer rights point of
view that a service takes reasonable efforts to make the service safer
to use for consumers.

even if the service is aimed at tech savvy users, it should at the
very least warn people when they choose a weak password (the little
strength meter), and if there is valuable data, two-factor passwords,
https, and other security measures should be a consumer right i think.

if a service puts users at risk of oversharing (no, i won't shut up
about it ;) or scams, i would say it is the duty of the service to
warn about this.

of course more "be safer online" education is needed if a service is
aimed at non-technical people and especially minors.

so i think facebook did not do this very well in the past, but is
doing a good job at it now.
