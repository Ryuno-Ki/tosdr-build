These user-facing safety tips are cool and all, but apparently
Facebook still doesn=92t use https =96 you have to enable =BBsafe browsing=
=AB.
For a communication platform this big that=92s downright irresponsible.
Sure, many people might read those tips (and forget them also) but it
seems like a pacifier compared to no https and tracking and all that.

(Right, by the way =96 what about storing info/passwords not encrypted,
that should be a data point right?)
