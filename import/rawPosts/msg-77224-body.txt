using startssl, it now costs no money, and about two hours of work, to
put an ssl certificate on a website. the only situation where this is
impossible is if you don't have the website running on its own IP
address (e.g. as a nodejitsu or 5apps or github-pages app). but if it
runs on rackspace or amazon or similar hosting platforms, there is no
real excuse not to offer https.
