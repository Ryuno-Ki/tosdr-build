 websites that integrate Twitter buttons or widgets, is an experiment that =
we're beginning to roll out to some users in a number of countries. Learn m=
ore here.=20
      * We've noted the many ways you can set your preferences to limit, mo=

 may be shared with others (for example, when you've given us permission to=
 do so, or when the data itself is not private or personal). Importantly, o=

 party's request for your information.=20
