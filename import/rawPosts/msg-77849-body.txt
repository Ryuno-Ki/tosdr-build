Hi,

I just read that Facebook's released a new kind of social plugin. Unlike
their "Like" button and social applets, developers using Facebook's Open
Graph API can also track users directly through Facebook.

I need to investigate a bit more, but here's an article from TechChrunch
http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/26/facebooks-hidden-like-isnt-just-good-for-m=
obile-developers-its-good-for-facebook/

Once you skip all the buzzwords and the future anticipation platitude,
there are interesting facts.

        But the Facebook =93like,=94 still relatively new in the grand
        scheme of things, has already become synonymous with =93market to
        me in my News Feed.=94 The decision to press the seemingly
        innocuous thumbs up now holds a meaning that even less technical
        folks have come to understand. It=92s the modern equivalent of
        =93add my name to your email distribution list.=94 (So far we=92ve
        come, so little has changed.)
       =20
        That=92s why the =93hidden=94 like is so interesting. It=92s integr=
ated
        seamlessly into the application. You=92re not =93liking=94 a Facebo=
ok
        Page, you=92re =93liking=94 an Instagram photo. And it=92s not a th=
umbs
        up icon =96 it=92s a little heart=85or whatever else the developer
        sees fit to use. The point being: it looks like part of the app
        itself. It will become impossible to tell (without reading all
        the pop-up disclaimers and EULAs =96 and who does?) which in-app
        actions will live within the app and which populate Facebook.
        And that=92s the idea. That=92s how they getcha.
       =20
        =85
       =20
        In a (not-so-distant?) future, you can see where this is headed,
        in terms of advertising. A user =93likes=94 Instagram photos of
        beaches and sunsets. The user then sees ads for vacations and
        cruises on Facebook. A user =93likes=94 a friend=92s Starbucks
        check-in in Foursquare, but has never =93liked=94 Starbucks=92 fan
        page on Facebook. Now Starbucks knows to show them ads and
        deals. It=92s the re-creation of the tracking cookie=92s
        capabilities in a =93web=94 where people surf mobile applications,
        not websites. And what could it become? The possibilities are
        mind-boggling. You =93like=94 photos of beaches, you launch a trave=
l
        app to book plane tickets for a work trip and find Caribbean
        vacation packages are now on sale. Coincidence, or =93like=94
        tracking? You may not know, but what=92s even better, is that you
        may not care.
       =20
I assume these things will start to popup in mobile apps terms, as well
as web apps.  If anyone's got an idea or want to dive in this detail
from Instagram e.g. feel free!
