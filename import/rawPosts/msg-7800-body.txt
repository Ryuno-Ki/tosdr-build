After applying for a position using CareerOne Australia, I noticed 
application confirmation & update eMails are going through a third party 
called jobg8 (http://jobg8.com/) who describes itself as, "Jobg8 is an 
online global marketplace for buying and selling qualified job 
applications."

Upon applying, I received an one sentence eMail confirming I applied for 
the position but was sent by noreply@jgmail.jobg8.com, labelled as 
ApplicationReceived@jobg8.com. I didn't realise it at the time I received 
it.

A couple of days later I received another eMail which came from 
noreply@jgmail.jobg8.com, labelled as ApplicationUpdate@jobg8.com. This 
time I noticed the address, as again I received boilerplate copy. There was 
little indication of which position it was referring to and wanted to reply 
to request more information.

Now I am thinking, "Who/what is jobg8.com and why do they have my eMail 
address?"

No where on the job listing page does it indicate my eMail address is going 
to be shared with jobg8.com or any other entity. During the application 
process users are required to accept the Terms of Use 
(http://inside.careerone.com.au/terms-of-use) and Privacy Policy 
(http://inside.careerone.com.au/policy/inside2.aspx) and do so by clicking 
"Apply" button. Opening and searching for "jobg8" has no results on either 
page. 

I went to the CareerOne site to contact them, ask about this and the 
message I sent through their "Contact Us" form apparently bounced as I 
received the following bounce notification. On it are even more domains 
which isn't too surprising:

On CareerOne's site, they have Privacy.officer@careerone.com.au as a 
contact. I'm going to try but I am going to wait a couple of days first to 
see if my message does actually make it to someone.

Any thoughts?
