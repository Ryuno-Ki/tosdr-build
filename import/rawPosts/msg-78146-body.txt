Gravatar terms:
        you hereby do and shall grant to Automattic a worldwide,

For those not familiar with gravatar, it's used by wordpress and other
websites to display a person's picture (the avatar). The picture is
chosen in association with the email address.  So typically, here's what
happens:

1. Alice writes a comment on Bob's wordpress blog as alice@5apps.com 
2. Bob's wordpress blog asks Gravatar if there's a picture associated
with the alice@5apps.com email address (i.e. if this email address is
associated with an account on Gravatar)
3. The picture is displayed (hard-linked from gravatar.com)

In practise, while there's a way to add and remove associated email
addresses and associated pictures to gravatar accounts; Gravatar
requires you to define one email address as your "primary" email
address. And you can't erase this one. The result is you can't leave the
service. (You will always have your username associated with at least
one primary email address of yours)
