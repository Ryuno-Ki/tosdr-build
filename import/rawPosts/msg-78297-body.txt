        "Tip: We do not disclose your private personal information
        except in the limited circumstances described here.=20
        [=85]
        "Business Transfers: In the event that Twitter is involved in a
        bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of
        assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of
        that transaction. The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply
        to your information as transferred to the new entity."
       =20
I wonder to which extent the last sentence is actually adding anything.
I suppose it is only there to make people feel comfortable.

Note: PrivacyParrot offers to analyze these types of clauses.
http://www.privacyparrot.com/popular

For comparison, Google's:
http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/
        "If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale,
        we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal
        information and give affected users notice before personal
        information is transferred or becomes subject to a different
        privacy policy. "
       =20
and Delicious' http://www.delicious.com/privacy :
        "Business Transfers.  AVOS may sell, transfer or otherwise share
        some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information,
        in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale
        of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.  We will provide you
        with notice of the transfer of your Personal Information to the
        new entity. "
       =20

So it's fairly common to consider private and personal information as
business assets, transferable.

ONOH, depending on the level of protection for the user that the privacy
policy provides (e.g. about where the data is stored and processed) I
don't think it really matters which company is doing it--the terms are
binding on them too (unless they are changed, but that can also happen
regardless of the business transfer).

OTOH, not having any of the personal/private data transferable could
make the company impossible to sell (because the company acquiring the
service would not be able to operate the service in full continuity,
which is causing a lot of disagreement.)

So in the end, unless we see surprising things in there, I have the
impression that we shouldn't really focus on this, as it seems more or
less irrelevant and accessory to the real issues.

Does anyone have a dissenting opinion? If not, I will also bring the
data point from Delicious about this to 0.
