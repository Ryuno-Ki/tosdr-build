I just committed the readjustments for Delicious. Basically in all our
categories Delicious gets quite a high score for mediocre terms, with a
special mention on "No Right to leave the service" at all since
Delicious retain a right to keep an archive for "legitimate business
purposes" whatever that might mean (a quick search through duckduckgo
with the terms indicates they are used a lot in the US but for very
different cases, i.e. most of the cases the company requires the users
to use the service only for legitimate business purposes)

3 categories have not been taken into account yet:
 - Suspension and censorship
 - Law enforcement (the data is store and processed only in the US)
 - Jurisdiction (it's California)

I lack data for these categories to really be able to judge. Especially
for the first one. But I doubt that this is enough to bring Delicious up
to class C=85 The US are not particularly known for being cautious about
these issues=85

So I will tweet with the ToS;DR account that Delicious gets class D
which right now states:
        "Class D  The terms of service are very uneven or there are some
        important issues that need your attention."
       =20

I invite anyone who disagrees or has a comment to speak up, this is an
open process!
