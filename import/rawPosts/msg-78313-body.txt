the fact that it's common practice to consider user data as a business
asset is the core of what is wrong with web 2.0 and SaaS. the fact
that everybody does it actually makes it worse, not acceptable.

if i have to pay money for a service then so be it. i don't want to
pay with my data.

of course, there is the administrative issue when a company switches
hands, that you don't want to interrupt the service.

therefore, Google's "give affected users notice before personal
information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy
policy." seems a basic consumer's right to me.

if the current service is replaced by a new one, i want *advance*
notice, so i can choose whether i want to opt out of my data being
transferred to the new party and the new policy. any service who
changes the content of the ToS or the company that provides the
service without advance notice, is IMO violating consumer's rights.

Twitter's and delicious' "your information may be sold"/"AVOS may sell
[...] your data" conveys the essence of web2.0's evil business model
where the user is a product instead of a customer.

I would crack down very hard on this. Just imagine that happening in
another context: "if you rent this house, then you agree that we may
sell all the furniture you put into it to the highest bidder, and keep
the money ourselves" - crazy! :)

If it means i have to pay money then so be it. i am aware that my
brand loyalty will always be for sale - but there i'm considered a
valued customer of a brand which makes the brand valuable. and if
company B continues a service that i was using from company A, then
i'll probably continue using it, so it's perfectly possible to base a
buyout-strategy on that. but i do not want my data to be sold, ever.

i own that data, so if someone else tries to sell it, and keep the
money themselves, then IMO they are thieves.

Cheers,
Michiel
