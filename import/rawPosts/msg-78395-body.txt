Tarik of Personal has a great presentation about how personal data can end
up in all kinds of places.
See Slides 12 and 13 of this:
http://www.slideshare.net/Personal_Inc/how-to-build-privacy-by-design-into-web-and-mobile


Personal has written some special filtering code to make sure personal
information doesn't end up in their server logs.
