Well Tarik's thing is about Privacy by Design, i.e. building privacy into
the technical architecture (the canonical resource for this is Ann
Cavoukian's website <http://privacybydesign.ca/>).

Privacy by Default is a subset of that. But really imporant. Most people
don't change their privacy settings, if they even know how to do it. So
whatever are the "default settings" of a service is critical.

I think both "Privacy by Design" and "Privacy by Default" could be useful
data points in ToS;DR!
