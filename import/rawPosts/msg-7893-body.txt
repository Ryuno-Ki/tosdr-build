Hi Yisela,

Sorry we're getting to this so late, but thank you very much for your 
contribution! In the future we do ask that you provide one point per 
thread. This allows for the discussions to be confined to single data 
points, rather than many, and thus for us to draw conclusions and post 
those points to the website. 

Thanks again!

Ian
