This is one year old. Since then, Twitter now has the same kind of terms
than Twitpic, and Twitter now hosts pictures themselves. As stated in
twitter.com/tos pictures are part of the "Content" subject to the broad
copyright license.

If Twitpic=92s New Deal Troubles You, Here Are Some Options
By PAUL BOUTIN

Word got out this week that Twitpic, the most popular service used by
Twitter users to upload and post photos, had struck an exclusive
partnership with World Entertainment News Network, a news and photo
agency that specializes in celebrity stories and pictures.

The deal allows the agency to sell images posted on Twitpic for
publication elsewhere. (Flickr, by contrast, expressly forbids the reuse
of its members' photos without their personal permission or a special
copyright designation that allows commercial use.)

Twitter users went ballistic, especially professional photographers,
because the deal effectively turned Twitpic's 20 million registered
users into a free photo pool from which someone else could potentially
make money for hot shots like Janis Krums' 2009 picture of Flight 1549
landing on the Hudson River, or Stefanie Gordon's recent photo (shown)
taken from her airplane seat, of the space shuttle Endeavor lifting off
through the clouds. Ms. Gordon told MSNBC that five news agencies had
paid her for use of her photo, which has been seen by millions, but many
more publishers had not.

World Entertainment News Network's chief executive said he was only
interested in photos posted by celebrity Twitter users, which is
W.E.N.N.'s specialty. But a brief statement from Twitpic dodged the
W.E.N.N. issue, stating only that Twitpic would clamp down on
unauthorized use of members' photos. "You allow us to distribute that
content on twitpic.com and our affiliated partners," the post reminded
users.

To be fair, your text messages are equally republishable by Twitter, as
stated in that company's nearly identical legalese. But some people feel
differently about their pictures.

The opportunity to have a hastily snapped photo become world-famous is
more appealing to many Twitter users than the need to get paid for it,
or to control its publication. But if Twitpic's terms of service bug
you, there's a quick fix: Change the settings on your Twitter mobile app
to switch the photo upload service from Twitpic to yfrog, the other
built-in option.

The terms of service of Yfrog, which is made by ImageShack, are pretty
blunt: "ImageShack will not sell or distribute your content to third
parties or affiliates without your permission. Third parties may
hyperlink to the page that displays your content on the ImageShack
Network without modification and with proper attribution to you. Third
parties may request permission to use your content by contacting you
directly. All requests for permission regarding your content usage
directed at ImageShack will be forwarded to you." So it seems unlikely
that pictures uploaded to yfrog will end up in, say, a TMZ story without
you getting a shot at royalties.

Should you delete your photos from Twitpic? Take a cue from the talk
show host Ellen Degeneres. In response to W.E.N.N.'s deal with Twitpic,
she stopped using Twitpic in her Twitter messages a couple of weeks ago.
She now posts photos to her own ellen.tv site. But she hasn't bothered
to go back and move all of her old pictures off of Twitpic. That makes
sense, because it's unlikely that World Entertainment News Network will
go data-mining Twitpic archives for old photos. What they want are the
latest snapshots of what's happening and who's hot right now, for which
Twitter is the best medium ever. That picture of the space shuttle? So
last week.
