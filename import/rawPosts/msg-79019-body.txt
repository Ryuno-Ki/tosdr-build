As you know, Google has decided to unify their ToS and privacy policy
under one umbrella rather than maintaining specific ToS for each of
their service.

This is both a good and a bad thing. The good thing is that this makes
things simpler to understand. The downside: you don't really know to
what service you agree :^) and your data for, say, a photo sharing
application, could be re-used later in another Google service that
didn't exist before.

This is reflected in the copyright license. Overall, this copyright
license seems reasonable enough compared to Facebook or Twitter for
instance, as it is limited. However this limitation goes beyond the
requirement for running the service, as it includes "promoting" the
service. But that seems okay to me. As pointed out earlier, the problem
lies in what constitutes "the service" itself because it is basically
any Google service, existing or not-yet-existing.

http://groups.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
        When you upload or otherwise submit content to our Services, you
        give Google (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use,
        host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as
        those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes
        we make so that your content works better with our Services),
        communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and
        distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license
        *are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and
        improving our Services, and to develop new ones*. This license
        continues even if you stop using our Services (for example, for
        a business listing you have added to Google Maps). Some Services
        may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been
        provided to that Service. Also, in some of our Services, there
        are terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the
        content submitted in those Services.
