That's exactly why I have said what matters is what the privacy policy
actually says about what data is collected, for what purpose, how long,
etc. The fact that the data which is collected for reasonable rasons
(e.g. an email address tied to a user name) is transferred along when
the company gets transferred seems normal to me.

As you point out, the Google paragraph is good; but that's the kind of
thing which should happen anyway when the privacy policy changes, no
matter if it's during a merger or anything else!

In a nutshell: if Company A owns your data, here's the problem. Whether
company A gets owned by company B or C or stays company A doesn't
matter. The problem arises when company A gets to own some of your data
that it shouldn't own.

"Own" here clearly means that it's data which is collected and for which
they have a right to sell, transfer it. That happens in two situations:
 - content under very broad copyright license (think: Facebook, Twitter)
 - data for which privacy policy states it can be transferred, shared,
publicised, etc.

So we need to focus on these 2 aspects rather than on the business
transfer aspect, which in most cases is irrelevant (although we still
should watch them in case something weird slips in).
