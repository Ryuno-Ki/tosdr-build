we are already filing lots of data points that don't fall into the 8
categories listed on tos-dr.info. If you want to categorize it, we
could make a new category called 'user information', which would cover
teaching users how to be safe, but also for instance readability of
ToS and openness about (planned) ToS changes, and maybe also allowing
the user themselves to see what data you keep of them (like the US
phone companies thing) would fall under 'informing the user'.
