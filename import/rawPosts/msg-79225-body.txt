cool! even if it weren't a legal requirement, or isn't in certain
countries, then i still think it's part of generic "Consumer Rights"
and best practice. but if a website is breaking the law, then that
obviously makes it worse.

Companies like Microsoft and Facebook already routinely break the law
on purpose afaik, and then just hire good lawyers to stall the verdict
for many years, until they're already rich. :(
