Title: Flattr notifies you of Privacy Policy changes by posting them to the 
site only

Topic: changes

Summary: If any changes are made to the Privacy Policy, those changes are 
posted to Flattr's site. However, there is no email notification sent. This 
is a very passive way of notifying users, and places more of a burden on 
the users than is necessary.

Score: 100 (mediocre)
