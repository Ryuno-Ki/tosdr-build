Hello everyone,

Yesterday, Michel and I had a chat with Peter and Dan from Tosback2. We
thought it would be a good idea to introduce ourselves here as well. I
am currently working on a project to rate Terms of Service:
        http://www.tos-dr.info 
        tosdr@googlegroups.com is our mailing-list (don't hesitate to
        join, we need more people to discuss legal issues, especially
        from the US; and more opinions and dialogue)
        
Our goal is to stop the biggest lie on the Web, no less! :) I am
referring of course to "I have read and agree to the Terms of Service"
so we want to raise awareness so that people understand what they sign
up for e.g. when they use Facebook or Twitter.

Of course, we're doing it the free software way. The website is under
AGPL-3.0 and our raw data (json files) CCBySA-3.0 and we're looking to
work on top of tosback2 and other groups (you might also be interested
in giving a look at tossos.com) 



Now maybe let me get more specific. For ToS;DR we needed to create
objects for each service with some data, e.g. with Facebook:
https://github.com/unhosted/ToS-DR/blob/master/services/facebook.json

        {
          "id": "facebook",
          "service": "Facebook",
          "url": "https://www.facebook.com",
          "rated": false,
          "tos": {
            "terms": "https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms",
            "privacy": "https://www.facebook.com/full_data_use_policy"
          },
          "related": [
            "diaspora"
          ],
          "last-diff": "https://www.tosback.org/diff.php?vid=1740",
          "last-archive": "", 
          "date": "2011-07-07",
          "clause": [
            "kizrN7qb1Ck",
            "kizrN7qb1Ck2",
            "VTlWfubfib4",
            "eff-back-in-congress",
            "eff-back-tell-user-no",
            "eff-back-transparency-data-50"
          ]
        }
        
^^^ a lot of this stuff is not finished, it was just written there as a
draft: for instance the last-diff thing , etc. All this will probably be
written in more details to be conform with tosback2.
        
Some of this information might be redundant with what tosback2's already
doing. Especially, it has always been our goal to integrate with
tosback2 -- so now that I have more information, we need to find a way
to build upon something like tosback2's facebook xml files:
      * https://github.com/pde/tosback2/blob/master/rules/facebook.com.xml (the most recent file)
      * https://github.com/pde/tosback2/blob/master/rules/facebook_Terms_of_Use.xml
      * https://github.com/pde/tosback2/blob/master/rules/facebook_Privacy_Policy.xml

So my question is: how is Tosback2 supposed to make use of several
documents for the same service? The case of Facebook is very common as
many services maintain separate documents for ToS and PP. (I want to
make a git pull request to give twitpic's ToS for instance, as so far
tosback2-data only has the PP)

The other point is that we started to maintain different objects for
service id and service url. So I wonder about the choice to maintain a
xml filename different from <sitename> (in the two older files) or if
this is deprecated. If this is deprecated and that sitename (which is
basically the service's url) and the service xml file should be the
same: what's the reason for this?

For instance, what about services using the same Terms but which can be
federated and accessed through different means, etc.? How can you group
websites with the same policies?

That was one of the main concern from my side for choosing to
differentiate a service's id with a service's url.

One last thing: I'm using pagekite to make my localhost available to the
world, so if I am connected, you can check the current development
version at http://synclavier.hugo.pagekite.me

Best,
