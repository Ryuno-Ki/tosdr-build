One of the changes made here is in regards to the Skype's Internet Communic=
ations Software license. If you are using an OS before Windows 8.1, it's li=
censed under Skype Software S=E0rl. If you are using a version that came wi=
th Windows 8.1 OS or later, the software is licensed under the OS you're ru=
nning.

To me, this puts more onus on the user. If they are prudent and reading the=
se terms, they still have to go and read MORE if they're running software t=
hat came with Windows 8.1 or later. I personally think this is a negative a=
nd should be reflected as such.

Also, when they mention third-party notices, they explicitly mention that S=
kype websites may include a third-party cookie, something they did not ment=
ion explicitly in the previous version. I like the transparency, but am not=
 sure it changes too much.

A third change mentions a possible requirement to download the newest versi=
on in order to continue using Skype. I don't like that. Even iTunes doesn't=
 require you to download the newest incarnation of the software in order to=
 continue use. This doesn't seem necessary. Skype ends up listing possible =
reasons that may require a software version update, however.=20

The other changes are mostly formatting and not really relevant to tosdr.
