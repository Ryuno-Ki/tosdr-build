This kind of stuff just seems so extreme. I don't get it. Although I do 
think it's nice of them to point out where you can go to disable (at least 
some of) the third-party cookies, I still think this kind of practice is 
over-the-top.

Title: Microsoft uses web beacons to track you across the internet

Topic: track

Summary: Microsoft uses web beacons which help them deliver cookies on 
their sites and in their promotional emails. They also work with other 
companies that advertise on Microsoft sites to place cookies and track your 
usage of those sites and products. However, they do provide links to help 
you opt out of these third-party cookies (such as Google Analytics).

Score: 70 (mediocre)
