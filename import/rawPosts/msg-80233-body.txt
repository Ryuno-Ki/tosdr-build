cool! i also found out some more shocking practices regarding cookies:

even if you delete your cookies or even in private browsing mode,
websites have ways to cookie you, for instance using Flash
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_shared_object or using Etags
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag#Tracking_using_ETags
or using html5 localStorage. check this out:

"over 5,600 standard HTTP cookies on popular sites, over 4,900 were
from third parties. Google-controlled cookies were present on 97 of
the top 100 sites, including popular government websites."

third party cookies are evil and unnecessary. it's one thing to cookie
your users yourself, but why would you presume the right to give your
users a third-party cookie without their consent?

"We found two sites that were respawning cookies, including one site =96
hulu.com =96 where both Flash and cache cookies were employed to make
identifiers more persistent. The cache cookie method used ETags, and
is capable of unique tracking even where all cookies are blocked by
the user and =93Private Browsing Mode=94 is enabled."

http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3D1898390

so the "well, people know they risk getting cookied when they go
online, and everybody who cares about privacy will have cookies
disabled" excuse doesn't apply there.

i really think that when we see third-party cookies, we should punish
both the second party and the third party, so in 97% of websites,
google, but facebook's like button is also all over the web. maybe in
case of the TweetThis widget we can be more forgiving because Twitter
takes the effort to delete your tracked data after 10 days, which is
at least a gesture of goodwill. Although a gesture of goodwill
sometimes means something else is being covered up, for instance,
twitter probably monetizes on your data within 10 days because they
are about fast-moving topics.

i think maybe we should not give class A unless a website has an
explicit "we don't track you" policy.

cheers,
Michiel
