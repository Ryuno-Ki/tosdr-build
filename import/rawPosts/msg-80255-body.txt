        The policy was criticised by EU officials for being too
        invasive.
        
        "At that point I had to make a decision," says Henderson. "Do I
        like the terms of service and am I willing to abide by it to use
        Google's products? And the answer in both cases was no."
        
        So Henderson decided to quit Google for good. He wrote a
        manifesto for IT World called How I Divorced Google and set
        about initiating the break-up.
        
        Four months later, he's still living a mostly Google-free
        existence.
        Privacy concerns
        
        Google's terms of service state that the information it collects
        is used primarily to make the browsing experience better.
        
        The firm also promises to share that information only in limited
        circumstances, unless users give consent.
        
        But Henderson wasn't satisfied that the policy could be
        enforced, and didn't feel confident that the sheer amount of
        information Google can collect wouldn't fall into the wrong
        hands.
        
        "Google isn't subject to an audit of what those practices are,"
        he says. "They're not telling whether they sell that info to
        insurance companies or people who want to market to you or
        people who don't like you at all."
