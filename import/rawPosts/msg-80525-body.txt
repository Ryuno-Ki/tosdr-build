Hello,

Nikopik is a trustable blog for me. I also found this long commented forum=
=20
post about it : =20
http://www.neowin.net/forum/topic/1089391-facebook-asking-users-to-help-eli=
minate-pseudonyms/ So=20
it seems legit too me.

Now concerning the fact itself, even though i can understand a website=20
having its policy (despite i disagree with this particular one, but it's=20
not the subject here) i can not see that move of calling for people to deno=
unce=20
each other to be a good thing. I would put it into a "hard to trust" or=20
"bad practices" tag where we could also add another point when they changed=
=20
the default contact e-mail to @facebook.com ones for many users.

J=E9r=E9my.
