Hi everyone,

I just discovered another project http://www.x2xroads.com/ which seems
to focus on EULAs. I am not how it works though. They seem to have a
system of "report cards" which allows people to make copies of EULAs so
they can read them afterwards.

They seem to be more focused on developing tools, IA and semantic
analysis, see http://www.x2xroads.com/behind-the-scenes

Apart from saying that they filed a patent (no joke, it's written at
least twice on the main pages) and that the development "will" be open
source, I have no idea whether it actually works already.

If anyone has additional elements about this project, you are welcome to
share them!

Best,
Hugo
