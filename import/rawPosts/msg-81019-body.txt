Hi Hugo, thanks for finding Youluh, I'm working on it, and I can tell you 
it's not operational yet.  We're building a prototype that we can use for a 
Kickstarter campaign or similar crowd funding.  Because of the way the 
service will record every agreement uploaded to it in each user's private 
library, the initial server capacity is budgeted very high, so we'll have a 
large startup cost.

The patent protection is primarily a hedge, the real plan is to release the 
code under the GPL, which has a clause which automatically grants a patent 
license to anyone using the code.  If the funding is successful, then we'll 
also donate the patent to Open Invention Network<http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/>
.

The way we attack the "didn't read" part of the problem is this: first we 
give the user a very easy way to upload a license prior to accepting it, 
typically an app or an extension that interacts with the clipboard to get 
the text of the license and send it to the user's private document 
repository on our service.  The document repository does let users read 
their license agreements later, if they want, but the real advantage is 
that we break the license down into clauses and find similar clauses across 
all the uploaded licenses, and return a report card of statistics to the 
user.  This way the user knows at a glance, prior to clicking "accept," 
whether there's anything *uncommon* in the license.

That's the basic benefit of the service, and it isn't great in terms of 
really informing the user what he's agreeing to.  But it's quick enough 
that typical users can interact with the service almost as fast as clicking 
"accept," and it's slightly better than clicking without reading at all. 
 And the service will also allows users to comment on clauses, so the 
report card will indicate whether there are comments to read about any of 
the clauses in the license.  In theory, we can include expert commentary in 
addition to average user commentary.  Negative comments, especially from 
experts, will produce a flag on the report card that will hopefully slow 
the user down and induce them to read the comment, and then maybe even the 
clause.
