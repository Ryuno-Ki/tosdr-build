Hi all!

I'm the CommonTerms coordinator, and yes, I have been in touch with Youluh!=
=20
I really like the idea of having your own repository of accepted (and=20
non-accepted) agreements somewhere, and a service to detect known and=20
unknown terms when you encounter a new agreement! It's very VRM:ish, too.

I am very happy to see how different project with different approaches to=
=20
solving the "Biggest Lie" problem are beginning to meet and talk!
The problem is not trivial, and it has many aspects, so I think we need to=
=20
cooperate.=20

This week, CommonTerms has been presenting at the Symposium for Usable=20
Privacy and Security (SOUPS), where we (myself and Gregg Bernstein) met=20
with researchers who contribute useful ideas, evaluations and=20
understanding. For example Patrick Gage Kelley, who did the very inspiring=
=20
"Nutrition Labels for Privacy" study at Carnegie Mellon University and=20
Adrienne Porter Felt who has done great research on permissions. We also=20
met Ashkan Soltani (FTC consultant, author of KnowPrivacy report), who=20
wants to see more cooperation.

I have also been discussing cooperation formats with Mark Lizar of the=20
Kantara initiative/PING, Renee Lloyd of CustomerCommons/VRM and a few=20
others. Still not sure what is the best way. What things do we need to=20
coordinate, and what things will be better solved if different groups try=
=20
different approaches? I have some ideas, but what do the rest of you think?

Best,
P=E4r Lanner=F6
