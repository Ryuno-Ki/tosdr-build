This is an article about a Russian man who scanned and altered the terms of 
a credit card for a bank, sent it back, and received his credit card. The 
bank didn't read the terms, which stated in part that he was granted an 
unlimited line of credit and that he wasn't obligated to pay any fees as a 
result of bank tariffs. He's sued them for not honoring the contract and 
was successful.
