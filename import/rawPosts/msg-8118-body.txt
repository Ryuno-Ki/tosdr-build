I don't like the 'EVEN IF WE KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN" part of this. If 
they knew or should have known, they should be held liable for that, 
especially from a user's point of view! I'm sure this phrasing exists in 
other services, but I can't recall seeing it before. 

Title: Microsoft limits their liability to you to $100.00

Topic: governance

Summary: Microsoft limits their liability to you to the price of one month 
of any service, or if there was no service, 100.00 USD. This holds true 
even for damages you incur that Microsoft knew about or should have known 
about.

Score: 90 (mediocre)
