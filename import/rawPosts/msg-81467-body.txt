500px has this clause in their terms
        =93You shall not have any right to terminate the permissions
        granted herein, nor to seek, obtain, or enforce any injunctive
        or other equitable relief against 500px, all of which such
        rights are hereby expressly and irrevocably waived by you in
        favour of 500px.=94

What is your opinion? Do you think that is acceptable? Somehow I fail to
see any valuable reason for a user to accept this kind of thing.=20

What if there is a problem in the service and that a picture I have
taken is mistakenly attributed to someone else and distributed via other
public channels I do not agree with (e.g. in my settings) or a picture,
that I might find offensive, is mistakenly attributed to me?

There can be many, many situations in which a service can fail on their
users. I do not see why as a user I should waive my right to seek
injunctive relief, etc.
