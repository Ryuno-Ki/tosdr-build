[Cc'ing Benjamin Jean to whom I briefly mentioned the clause last week
in Geneva]

500px is a service for photographers to share pictures, create
portfolios, etc. The service also have a paid-for account which gives
you access to the 500px Store.

The Store has some terms of its own, including:
=93you hereby irrevocably waive all moral rights in your Store Images;=94

So I have some questions:
      * to which extent this kind of clause is legal in most countries
        which have signed the Berne convention
      * what is the rationale for the service to ask the user to give up
        on their moral rights? Wouldn't it be perfectly possible to run
        their service without this clause?

This might be widespread, but it is the first service involving sharing
pictures where I read such a waiver.

Best,
