Hi!

Several projects have appeared recently that try to solve the "biggest lie"=
 problem, ie. the fact that online Privacy Polices and Terms of Service (To=
S) are broken. Almost nobody can read them but everybody has to say they re=
ad them. Here's a few such projects: Tossos, CommonTerms, Youluh, StandardL=
abel, Privacyscore, TosBack, EmanciTerm, Iubenda, Docracy, Customer Commons=
 ... (pls fwd on to others) So a couple of us have gotten together to try a=
nd help.=20

We believe that all these projects should have a place to meet and coordina=
te efforts!
A place to find out what others are doing, discuss solutions and problems, =
find partners (and competitors), liaise with work results, and initiate any=
 standardization work that may be needed. With a first standard proposal al=
ready started for an open notice format standard so that all of our work ef=
forts can collaborate.=20

To start the collaboration rolling we just created a mailing list and websi=
te. If you want to join, please add yourself here:http://groups.google.com/=
group/opennotice=20

Or read more here:
