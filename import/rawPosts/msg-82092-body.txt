Hi,

I am also very happy to see so many projects coming together each one of
them focusing on some aspect of the biggest problem :) One thing we need
to solve is how to connect each of these solutions.

One obvious thing is that we need to have a common way to refer to the
same services. Take for instance Facebook.com

      * Tosback2 has a rule file:
        https://github.com/pde/tosback2/tree/master/rules/facebook.com.xml
      * ToS;DR will have a JSON object, which refers to tosback2 for
        now: http://tos-dr.com/services/facebook.json or more recent:
        https://github.com/unhosted/ToS-DR/blob/gh-pages/services/facebook.=
json

and then we need to be able to refer to the same clauses:
      * Tosback2 doesn't have a front-end yet, but we can use github
        lines anchors for now, like
        https://github.com/pde/tosback2-data/blob/data/crawls/facebook.com/=
Privacy-Policy/raw/www.facebook.com/about/privacy/index.html#L16=20
      * at ToS;DR we have JSON objects for data points, which can refer
        to facebook. For example:
        http://tos-dr.info/points/Rd9OhF6jeBg.json


Once we have a standard for referring to both and use the same
identifiers, we could link everything together.
