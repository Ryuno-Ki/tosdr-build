But I personally don't believe it can be neutral. ToS;DR is obviously not=
=20
"neutral" as it's clearly giving opinions, value-judgement about what's=20
good/bad for the user. What's important is independence, openness and=20
transparency. This is what I have tried to do with the project: an open=20
mailing list, inviting people to give feedback and engage in discussions,=
=20
and adopting the "release early release often" approach that's so=20
successful in developing free software, with the github repos.

Maybe a call would be a bit overcrowded to begin with :-)

I suppose we should all join the opennotice mailing list, or any list where=
=20
we can all discuss. For realtime discussions, maybe you can join our IRC=20
channel on irc://irc.freenode.net:6667 #tosdr=20

I'll start with a brief description of myself. I study a master of law in=
=20
Paris, at Sciences Po while being a member of the board of the Free=20
Software Foundation Europe where I also serve as Deputy Coordinator for the=
=20
Legal Team, http://fsfe.org/legal=20

ToS;DR is my summer-personal project, working in Berlin with the=20
Unhosted.org crew. The idea is to present an easy way for users to get what=
=20
they need to know about terms they are about to sign, or have signed. We're=
=20
giving them the most important: how good is it in general? What specific=20
issues are there? see www.tos-dr.info The way we work is mainly on this=20
mailing list, which serves as starting point for discussion and analysis,=
=20
then when there's agreement or consensus i write a json object on the=20
website, and the data gets presented to the user on the website. I write=20
everything with openness and interoperability in mind, so that others can=
=20
link and build on top of it (for instance a browser extension alerting=20
users about to sign up that the service in question is Class E, e.g.=20
Twitpic)
