        To Sum It Up
       =20
        Basically, be nice, respect the law and think before you post.
        In most cases, we'll send you a warning before we take other
        measures and we'll always try to act reasonably. We think this
        is fair but if you don't agree, maybe SoundCloud is not the
        place for you.
       =20
There is nothing out of the extraordinary here. Basically, offensive
comments, spam and uploading unauthorised content will give you a
warning or in extreme cases direct suspension of the account.=20

I think it is quite neutral, but those are good to know. So I think it
makes sense to point them out on the ToS;DR of Soundcloud.
