What do you think of Soundcloud's ToS copyright license?
http://soundcloud.com/terms-of-use#license

        By uploading or posting Your Content to the Platform, you
        initiate an automated process to transcode any audio Content and
        direct SoundCloud to store Your Content on our servers, from
        where you may control and authorise the use, reproduction,
        transmission, distribution, public display, public performance,
        making available and other communication to the public of Your
        Content on the Platform and elsewhere using the Services. To the
        extent it is necessary in order for SoundCloud to provide you
        with any of the aforementioned hosting services, to undertake
        any of the tasks set forth in these Terms of Use and/or to
        enable your use of the Platform, you hereby grant such licences
        to SoundCloud on a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive,
        royalty-free and fully paid basis.
        By uploading Your Content to the Platform, you also grant a
        limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid up,
        licence to other users of the Platform, and to users of any
        other websites, apps and/or platforms to which Your Content has
        been shared or embedded using the Services (=93Linked Services=94),
        to use, copy, transmit or otherwise distribute, publicly
        display, publicly perform, prepare derivative works of, make
        available and otherwise communicate to the public Your Content
        within the parameters set by you using the Services. You can
        limit and restrict the availability of certain of Your Content
        to other users of the Platform, and to users of Linked Services,
        at any time using the settings on the sound page for each sound
        you upload, subject to the provisions of the Disclaimer section
        below.
       =20
        The licences granted in this section are granted separately with
        respect to each item of Your Content that you upload to the
        Platform. Licences with respect to audio Content, and any images
        or text within your account, will (subject to the following
        paragraph of these Terms of Use) terminate automatically when
        you remove such Content from your account. Licences with respect
        to comments or other contributions that you make on the Website
        will be perpetual and irrevocable, and will continue
        notwithstanding any termination of your account.
       =20

I like the fact that:=20

      * the license to soundcloud itself is very limited to the hosting,
        and to the services that they provide;
      * the content is licensed "horizontally" to all other users of the
        platforms according to the parameters set forth for each of the
        songs (terminate automatically when you remove)


This allows easily for creative commons licensing, and indeed it is even
a service provided by soundcloud as seen on
http://soundcloud.com/creativecommons

Any other thought? For me, that looks perfect. It is delightful to see
that some services get it right!
