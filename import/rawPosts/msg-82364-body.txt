I still have to think through what the differences between those
actually mean. But it is possible that I overestimated some of these
clauses so far=85 Are they really needed?

Let's have an hypothetical case, where someone uploads a remix on
soundcloud. That remix contains a sample of a song by Frank Zappa. Then,
Gail Zappa of the "Zappa Family Trust" hears about the song, gets upset
and sends a DMCA-style notice to Soundcloud.

First thing: it's not obvious that the remix is copyright infringement.
Let's say the sample is very brief and does not seem to qualify for
"originality."

Second thing: what will Soundcloud do? At this time, it's in their hands
to be prompt at removing alleged infringing material. If they fail to
comply with the law (DMCA, or ecommerce or whatever similar law applies
in our case) why should I indemnify them? All I did is upload a remix
which I thought, in good faith, was totally ok under copyright law.

Third thing: if it is my content, then I can still be sued by Zappa, or
Soundcloud (for breaching their terms). I would prefer to have
everything dealt with by a judge under copyright/contract law, than to
have everything handled from a contractual obligation raised from a
lawsuit between Soundcloud and some copyright holder.

In the end, not having these broad indemnification clauses does not seem
to close any opportunity for soundcloud to get back at their users if
something goes wrong. So they don't seem necessary for me, although they
do create some non-negligible risks.

What do others think?
