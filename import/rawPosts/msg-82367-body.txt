http://soundcloud.com/terms-of-use#termination
Termination:

        You may terminate this Agreement at any time by sending notice
        in writing to SoundCloud at Rosenthalerstr. 13, 10119 Berlin,
        Germany confirming such termination, by removing all of Your
        Content from your account, by deleting your account and
        thereafter by ceasing to use the Platform. If you have a premium
        account, then we will cease to charge you from the first day of
        the month following receipt of notice of termination from you,
        but cannot offer any refund for any unexpired period of your
        subscription.
       =20
        SoundCloud may suspend your access to the Platform and/or
        terminate this Agreement at any time if (i) you are deemed to be
        a Repeat Infringer as described above; (ii) you are in breach of
        any of the material provision of these Terms of Use or our
        Community Guidelines, including without limitation, the
        provisions of the following sections: Your Use of the Platform,
        Your Content, Grant of Licence, and Your Representations and
        Warranties; (iii) SoundCloud elects at its discretion to cease
        providing access to the Platform in the jurisdiction where you
        reside or from where you are attempting to access the Platform,
        or (iv) in other reasonable circumstances as determined by
        SoundCloud at its discretion.

I have seen in other places of the terms that the content you delete is
really deleted.=20
http://soundcloud.com/terms-of-use#account
        You may terminate your account at any time as described in the
        Termination and Right of Cancellation section below. Any attempt
        to terminate your account by means other than those described in
        the Termination and Right of Cancellation section will not be
        considered a proper termination.
       =20
        Once your account has been terminated or cancelled, any and all
        Content residing in your account, or pertaining to activity from
        your account (for example, data relating to the distribution or
        consumption of your sounds), will be irretrievably deleted by
        SoundCloud, except to the extent that we are obliged or
        permitted to retain such content, data or information for a
        certain period of time in accordance with applicable laws and
        regulations and/or to protect our legitimate business interests.
        You are advised to save or back up any material that you have
        uploaded to your account before terminating or cancelling your
        account, as SoundCloud assumes no liability for any material
        that is irretrievably deleted following any cancellation of your
        account. SoundCloud is not able to provide you with any .csv or
        other similar file of data relating to activity associated with
        your account, whether before or after termination or
        cancellation. This data is provided and is accessible only for
        viewing via your account page on the Website for as long as your
        account is active.
