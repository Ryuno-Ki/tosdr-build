http://soundcloud.com/pages/privacy#information gives a list of purposes
for which the personal data are used. The purposes are reasonable.

http://soundcloud.com/pages/privacy#sharing=20
        We will not share your personal information with any third
        party, except as described in this Privacy Policy. There are
        circumstances where we may need to share some of the personal
        information we collect about you or which you provide to us -
        these circumstances are as follows:
       =20
Most seems reasonable.

I'll emphasise:
      * If required by law: We will disclose your personal information
        if we believe in good faith that we are permitted or required to
        do so by law, including in response to a court order, subpoena
        or other legal demand or request.
      * To protect our interests: We may disclose your personal
        information if we feel this is necessary in order to protect or
        defend our legitimate rights and interests, or those of our
        users, employees, directors or shareholders, and/or to ensure
        the safety and security of the Platform and/or the SoundCloud=AE
        community.
      * In the context of a business transfer: We may disclose your
        personal information to any person or company that acquires all
        or substantially all of the assets or business of SoundCloud, or
        on a merger of our business, or in the event of our insolvency.
      *=20

Also quite important,=20
        Access to your Data
       =20
        As described above, most of the personal information you provide
        to us can be accessed and updated in the =93Settings=94 page of you=
r
        SoundCloud=AE account. If you wish to access, amend or delete any
        other personal information we hold about you, or if you have any
        objection to the processing of any information that we hold
        about you, please contact us at privacy@soundcloud.com, or the
        address provided below.
       =20
        If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings
        page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period of
        time, but we may need to retain some of your personal
        information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where
        we have a legitimate reason for doing so.
