Hi,=20

I have decided to give a look back at Twitter's practice regarding
changing their ToS.

So, one thing is they don't organise user feedback like Facebook, and
they don't give a minimum delay for users to review the changes (as
Google, Facebook and Soundcloud do for instance).

One of the problematic thing was the notification. As I said, there was
a blogpost the very same day the terms got changed (so no delay at all)
and an email:
> -- 1. except for an email, as they claim in the blogpost. But I can't
> find any email of the sort in September 2009.=20

I have asked around on Twitter if anybody had received such email.
Someone got it and forwarded it to me. The email is very, very light (no
information about the changes, just information that the terms have
changed and a link to blog.twitter.com)

The blog post is very light:
http://blog.twitter.com/2009/09/twitters-new-terms-of-service.html and
the key sentence about the change in copyright licenses is synthesised
as:
        Ownership=97Twitter is allowed to "use, copy, reproduce, process,
        adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute" your
        tweets because that's what we do. However, they are your tweets
        and they belong to you.

Curiously enough, no mention that this includes also the right to
sublicense, which to me is an important aspect.

In order to reflect this I have changed slightly the point.
