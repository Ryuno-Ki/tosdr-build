This is common practice from what I can tell. That being said, I think that=
=20
people using tosdr will still want to know for sure that services they use=
=20
don't technically own the user content.

Title: You retain ownership of your content

Topic: ownership

Summary: With the exception of any content that Microsoft licenses to you=
=20
(such as clip art), you retain ownership of your content (data, documents,=
=20
video, photos, music, email, instant messages). Microsoft makes no=20
ownership claims on any content you upload.

Score: 80 (good)
