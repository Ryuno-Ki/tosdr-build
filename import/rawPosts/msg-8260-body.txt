I wouldn't really say this is bad. 15 days certainly isn't the best heads 
up, but it certainly beats not being notified. If I remember correctly, 
Google's notification of changes in terms is only 14 days.

Title: You'll be notified 15 days before a price change

Topic: user-info

Summary: Microsoft can change the price of paid services at any time, but 
they will notify you by email at least 15 days before the price change is 
to happen.

Score: 20 (good)
