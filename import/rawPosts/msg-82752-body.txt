Hello,

So, as you can see on http://unhosted.github.com/ToS-DR/ we are getting
more and more information organised.

The roadmap states:
        Mid-July: Finishing analysis of major terms: social networks,
        search engines, photo sharing, blogs.
        End-July: Implementation of comparisons by category or specific
        topic; Improvement of score and rating systems.
       =20
I still have to put some time to polish and finish Twitter, Facebook,
Google and Dropbox. But that's pretty much it. We already get
SoundCloud, Twitpic, 500px, Delicious, DuckDuckGo, SeenThis and GitHub
done (or pretty much done). That will make 11.

I propose the next ones should be: Linkedin, Wikipedia, OpenStreetmap,
Flickr, OwnCube, and Instagram. If you have other suggestions of service
we should start focusing on, please speak out! That will make 17
services.

As for the features, Michiel and I are working on the topics page,
http://unhosted.github.com/ToS-DR/topics.html and then I will also start
to automate the scoring system.

Then, with 17 services and all the data, we should be able to present it
publicly and to invite people to contribute (in crowdsourcing fashion)
and to integrate (API, etc.)=20

Hopefully, all this will be ready for the end of August, when I will
present ToS;DR at Campus Party, in Berlin. See
http://www.campus-party.eu/2012/security.html

I will not be available a lot next week, as I will spend most of it near
Rostock for Zappanale :-) But maybe meanwhile people here can
contribute! Everything is important, every detail matters.=20

I would like to get any feedback on your experience so far. I am also
thinking of writing a short "howto" to invite people to contribute more
to the list and report on terms they read.

Best,
Hugo
