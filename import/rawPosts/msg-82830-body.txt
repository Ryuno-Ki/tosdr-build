Hi Hugo and thanks for connecting me to this group! =20

lso a blog but I don't understand what it is.

VRM technically translates to Vendor Rights' Management.   It is a project =
at Harvard's  Berkman Center for Internet and Society started by Doc Searls=
.   ProjectVRM has a set of Principles and Goals that collectively seek to =
restore balance in 'marketplace relationships' by building awareness and to=
ols.   The community has taken these principles and started a number of pro=
jects each interpreting the goals and applying them to a particular issue. =
  Much of VRM stems from Doc's work in "The Cluetrain Manifesto" around the=
 notion of the 'captive' customer.   Doc was at Berkman to explore and deve=
lop VRM based on this concept.   We were fellow Fellows at Berkman and his =
  My connection with VRM focuses largely on legal practice from the perspec=
tive of the individual and increasingly from the small company who seeks to=
 follow something other than the standard silicon valley model. =20

Personally, my background prior to my fellowship at Berkman was heavily foc=
used on corporate technology IP law both in large law firms and technology =
companies.  In 2006, I was recruited to join Harvard's Technology Developme=
nt Office as Assistant Director of Technology Transactions because federal =
funding for research was less available and industry funding was increasing=
 and with it more complex and demanding deal terms.   This experience (repr=
esenting academics dealing with companies) gave me the opportunity to consi=
der the approach, framework and content of deals from an entirely different=
 perspective.   After a year, I realized there was a great deal that in the=
 context of the internet we were increasingly becoming 'codified' by a very=
 limited corporate legal practice, a belief confirmed when I co-charied the=
 Computer and Internet Committee for the Boston Bar Association.   I went t=
o Berkman to explore this further which led to connecting with Doc which I =
discuss above.  =20

>> That said, I believe that legal practice can be 'hacked' to provide solu=
tions that at a minimum are neutral (meaning they facilitate the necessary =
transaction no more no less).   That alone would benefit people.  =20
>=20
> I think we can build a process which is open to everybody and transparent=
. But I personally don't believe it can be neutral. ToS;DR is obviously not=
 "neutral" as it's clearly giving opinions, value-judgement about what's go=
od/bad for the user. What's important is independence, openness and transpa=
rency. This is what I have tried to do with the project: an open mailing li=
st, inviting people to give feedback and engage in discussions, and adoptin=
g the "release early release often" approach that's so successful in develo=
ping free software, with the github repos.
I completely agree with your approach to developing successful terms.   Wit=
h respect to my comment about neutrality, I actually believe that the neutr=
al 'sweet spot' exists in simply understanding the transaction.  For exampl=
e, if a company needs the user to grant them the legal right (permission) t=
o post, then the language should reflect that rather than exploiting that t=
o include broader overreaching rights.   Make sense?  =20
> =20
>> But before, I go on, I think that it would be a helpful first step for u=
s to have a call, introduce ourselves and just share a bit about what we ar=
e doing, what we need, etc.    From there we will have a better idea about =
who we need to collaborate with and can come up with ideas on how to best f=
acilitate collaboration.   Make sense? =20

ed to know about terms they are about to sign, or have signed. We're giving=
 them the most important: how good is it in general? What specific issues a=
re there? see www.tos-dr.info The way we work is mainly on this mailing lis=
t, which serves as starting point for discussion and analysis, then when th=
ere's agreement or consensus i write a json object on the website, and the =
data gets presented to the user on the website. I write everything with ope=
nness and interoperability in mind, so that others can link and build on to=
p of it (for instance a browser extension alerting users about to sign up t=
hat the service in question is Class E, e.g. Twitpic)
I REALLY LIKE THIS PROJECT!  In fact this is something that I've wanted to =
do at thosesneakybastards.org.   Any chance i could link to it and share it=
 there too? =20
