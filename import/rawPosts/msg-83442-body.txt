As you can read at
http://blog.twitter.com/2012/07/twitter-transparency-report.html Twitter
decided to join Google http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/ in
their action for more transparency on governments' requests to access
data and DMCA notices from copyright holders.

I have been sitting with this on my to-do list for almost a month now. I
still don't know what to do with them. While I acknowledge this is a
good thing to shed light on gov and BigCorp practices, I have the
feeling that I shouldn't mention them, and instead concentrate on their
actual practices.

For instance in the case of Twitter:
         One example is our long-standing policy to proactively notify
        users of requests for their account information unless we=92re
        prohibited by law; another example is transmitting DMCA takedown
        notices and requests to withhold content to Chilling Effects.
       =20
I note that this might also duplicate data with what the EFF provides
every year in their "EFF has your back" report.

So I decided not to include them.
