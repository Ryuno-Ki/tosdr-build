There's a lot of law on that, yes -- in short, material changes are those=
=20
that adversely affect the party that didn't make the change. For example,=
=20
if I run a company and I have terms of service, I can change the terms of=
=20
service to update my mailing address. That isn't a material change. It=20
doesn't materially alter the agreement (in other words, it doesn't *affect*=
 you,=20
so you don't really have the right to complain).=20

However, I can't go in and add an arbitration clause. I can't go in and=20
change the amount you're charged for services. That adversely affects you,=
=20
the user. That's a material change; it's a change in the basic agreement.=
=20
If I assert that I can alter the agreement to that extent, courts may say=
=20
there is no agreement *at all*, and the whole contract is void.
