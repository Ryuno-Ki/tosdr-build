Hello everybody,

First thank you Hugo and Michiel for your initiative and your interface 
made for everybody and developers.
If i understood well, you make a global rating on companies Tos and policy. 
I try to make the same for developers with API Tos and API policy ratings

On my rating criterias about trust, one of the 5 sub-criterias is "Trust in 
the company" and looks like to your rating. I will probably contribute with 
you on this side to help everybody, so developers, to know how far they can 
trust a company. I'm working now on Big API companies (Google, Twitter, 
Facebook, Foursquare etc... and bring my results to developers and to your 
site)

You can see the beginning of my work on api500.tumblr.com, which will be 
soon a real site with an API too.

Let's work together on trust for the web.

Mehdi
