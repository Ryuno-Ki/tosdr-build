Hi

It's great that finally somebody care about improving the situation with 
those ToS.
For me, the main questions are:

   - What are my liabilities if I accept the ToS? (legal, financial)
   - What does the service provider guarantee? (usually nothing)
   - Who owns what data?


A service where I can configure acceptable ToS service terms (preferences*) 
would be nice (online service or browser extension).
Service provides should have the main aspects of their ToS in machine 
readable form (similar to robots.txt). A simple service could check the ToS 
against my ToS preferences. After such a check I could click "accept" 
without reading the ToS.

*) maybe a kind of whitelist (things I always accept) / blacklist (things 
I'll never accept)

The first step would be to have a rather simple vocabulary for the most 
important ToS terms. And after that iterate and extend.
