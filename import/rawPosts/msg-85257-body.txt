although your points represent a valid use case, these are two
different propositions.

think about the eco label for washing machines that exists in Europe.
If i go buy a washing machine i want to buy a good one, from the
perspectives of price, performance, and ecology. i am not an expert on
how the water that it uses kills fish and how the electricity that it
uses impacts global fossil fuel reserves. also, i'm not very
interested in learning about it. there are experts for that, who
studied geography and biology and chemistry and got together and made
that rating saying my washing machine is a class C from a generic,
opaque, ecology point of view.

the ratings produced by ToS;DR are usable by non-experts as opaque ratings.

apart from that there is the discussion on this mailing list, where
obviously the ratings are not opaque because we are building them. and
the info is obviously available because this is an open process. but
providing a multi-dimensional rating to end-users is a very different
proposition than providing an opaque one.

the multi-dimensional summary using icons and categories and what-not
has been tried many times; there's probably a new icons project each
month or so, see for instance
http://solon.barocas.org/?page_id=200%20) for a list.

ToS;DR is different in that it aims at an opaque (one-dimensional)
rating. At first sight this seems to deprive the end user of choice
and autonomy, and it seems controversial to distinguish between end
users and experts. as hackers we're used to always being a driver and
a mechanic at the same time. but removing the specifics is exactly how
the rating becomes simple and usable imho.

also, it would be quite difficult to successfully implement such an
idea of multi-dimensional choices. it may sound like an enhancement,
but have you really thought about your whitelist/blacklist yet and how
that personalization would make the ratings more usable to you? can
you give an example maybe? for me, the issue of abusive ToS is more a
matter of principle. i don't want to be fucked over by a billionaire,
full stop. and i don't want other people to be. if a service is evil,
then i want it to be called out, regardless of whether i personally
suffer the effects.

i hope this explains the rationale a bit of why we set it up without
such personalization controls. still, this is an open project and
we're only creating a first version. so you are free to make a start
with adding such controls if you have an idea of how you would want to
do it, and then if more people want them too, the project will
naturally move in that direction, its roadmap is under the control of
whoever contributes to it.

ciao!
Michiel
