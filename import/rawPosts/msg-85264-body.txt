Hi!

we were alerted that http://tos-dr.info/ is not working in Internet
Explorer: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4353207

Does anybody on this list have the skills to fix that? The code is
quite hacky but what it does is recursively fetch the list of services
and of data points using XHR. Apparently this is simply not happening
if you open the site in Internet Explorer. If someone can check why
this might be then that would be awesome! the code is on
https://github.com/unhosted/ToS-DR

ciao,
Michiel
