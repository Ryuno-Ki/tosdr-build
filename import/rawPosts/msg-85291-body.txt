Hi ToSDR'ers,

When I first considered using Gravatar, I looked at the ToS (
http://en.gravatar.com/site/terms-of-service) and was quite appalled at 
this part:
 

> More specifically, you hereby do and shall grant to Automattic a 
> worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free and fully-paid, 
> transferable (including rights to sublicense) right to perform the Services 
> (e.g., to use, modify, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, 
> display, perform, and otherwise fully exercise and exploit all intellectual 
> property, publicity, and moral rights with respect to any User Submissions, 
> and to allow others to do so).


Looks to me like they're grabbing all rights they possibly can, including 
the rights to pass on your works.  Not sure which categories you would put 
these in (or if I just misread something), but I give them several thumbs 
down for this.

-Lars
