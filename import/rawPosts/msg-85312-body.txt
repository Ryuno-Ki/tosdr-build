This is completely out of context.  The rest of the provision is pretty awful, actually.  Some reasons I say this:

1.  The user must use the contact form provided by XING.  Why not just press a 'delete' button in the user's settings?

2.  Nothing about returning/destroying the user's personal information in XING's systems.

3.  Lots of nonsense about XING being able to choose not to renew premium service.

Who cares if you can terminate a free service, unless it promises to return/destroy your personal info (and stop using it)?  You were always able just stop using it.

What XING is doing here is putting lipstick on a pig.  Don't fall for it.



IAAL, so I have to do this:
