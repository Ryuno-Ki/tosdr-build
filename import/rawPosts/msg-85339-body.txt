thanks! in my opinion one important rule would be to treat any data
the user inputs as theirs instead of yours. just promise not to look
at a user's non-public data other than for sysadmin tasks (so not for
making money). have a look at the positive and negative points that
have been mentioned on this mailing list, and try applying them to
your own product to see how you can do better.

you can browse http://tos-dr.info/topics.html for inspiration.

hope this helps & good luck with the product!


Cheers,
Michiel
