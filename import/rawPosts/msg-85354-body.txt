Some other points raised at
http://kendraserra.tumblr.com/post/28986523388/how-to-not-read-terms-of-ser=
vice

Except from the fact that she assumes I don't understand what a binding
legal document is, it is true that if users are going to believe that
there is a legal requirement by Google to defend them in court (because
they'd assume it's in the ToS, since that's how we present ourselves) --
then we're doing it wrong.=20

But that poses a valid question that I raised the first day we worked on
this with Michiel and Jan: what's the scope? How far do we get from just
rating terms of service to rating services as a whole?

One of the problem as highlighted above tends to prove that we should
stay more focused on terms.=20

One other argument in this direction is that the problematic points are
coming from the EFF's report. So the data is already out there. So
there's no need to get it in.

So I will continue on my way from this morning and remove the remaining
irrelevant points.
