Hey Hugo and ToS;DR folks,
Sorry, didn't mean to start a Twitter firestorm. I was actually planning to
email you guys about something separate in the GitHub terms, so I'm glad
the conversation got started, even if it wasn't on the note I intended.

And Hugo - my apologies that the post came off as directly addressed to you
and thus implied that I think you don't know that Terms are legally
binding. (I saw that you were a law student, and definitely don't think
that!)

I was actually trying to articulate what I see as a larger problem - that
laypeople reading Terms don't understand the context in which they written,
and thus read them as policy and not legal. I thought that the ToS;DR
discussion was a good way to frame the difference.

I guess my problem can be summed up as a labeling one - it scares me that a
visitor to your site who go there to be informed (and thus doesn't click
through) could reasonably come to the conclusion that Google's court
defense is part of its Terms. I think sticking to a narrower scope could
help with that.

Kendra

Le mercredi 08 ao=FBt 2012 =E0 15:22 +0200, Hugo Roy a =E9crit :<br>
&gt; As pointed out on <a href=3D"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3D43=

&gt; the &quot;US Congress lobbying&quot; is out of scope and should be rem=
oved from<br>

Except from the fact that she assumes I don&#39;t understand what a binding=
<br>
legal document is, it is true that if users are going to believe that<br>
there is a legal requirement by Google to defend them in court (because<br>
they&#39;d assume it&#39;s in the ToS, since that&#39;s how we present ours=
elves) --<br>
then we&#39;re doing it wrong.<br>
<br>
But that poses a valid question that I raised the first day we worked on<br=

this with Michiel and Jan: what&#39;s the scope? How far do we get from jus=
t<br>
rating terms of service to rating services as a whole?<br>
<br>
One of the problem as highlighted above tends to prove that we should<br>
stay more focused on terms.<br>
<br>
One other argument in this direction is that the problematic points are<br>
coming from the EFF&#39;s report. So the data is already out there. So<br>
there&#39;s no need to get it in.<br>
