you are right that we should be careful about that. let's see how we
can present data points in a listing that makes this clearer.

Some points are about ToS, some are about Privacy Policy, and some are
about other manifestations of good or bad treatment of "user rights".
So let's label them accordingly and it should be fine?

But i think it can be fixed by making the data presentation clear and
transparent.

One important point i think is that this is not a summary service, our
product is a rating. if we say a certain website gets for instance a
"class B" rating for how they treat their users, then i think we
should include all reliable information we have about the things they
will do to you, whether that information comes from the ToS or the PP
or their blog or their help pages or other reliable information
services. ignoring information just because it is not legally binding
would paint an incomplete picture imho.

we do restrict ourselves to only user rights (or "consumer rights" as
i sometimes also call them) though. so for instance if the product
quality is low, or the site goes down all the time, or the data center
happens to use nuclear power instead of green power, that would all be
outside of the 'user rights' scope and doesn't affect the rating.

but a company defending your rights in court is definitely positive
and significant and also related to user rights, i would say, so i
would want it to affect the rating we give to that service.


my 2ct,
Michiel
