We actually have since the beginning a "source" element which typically
goes like "source": "terms" or "source": "privacy".

I propose we add something like "source": "not-binding" and when that
string is present, we display these points in a separate section making
sure that people understand it's not binding, just practice. These
not-binding points shuold not be shown on the front page either.

So I guess that makes our need to be able to have a triage in points is
becoming even more important than before :)
