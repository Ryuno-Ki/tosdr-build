Hi Michiel,

My impression is that we have different problem statements for the ToS 
topic.

I would love to have a "helper" service that tells me whether it's safe to 
click "I accept" without regarding the ToS at all. In addition to that the 
service might present me a list of all the ToS terms that I've accepted 
over the last 15 years or so.

Your classification system could be regarded as a longterm incentive for 
websites to define fair and balanced ToS.

*...but have you really thought about your whitelist/blacklist yet and how 
that personalization would make the ratings more usable to you? can 
you give an example maybe?*

Sure.  See a very rough example:

First (ToS project): define the vocabulary respectively the set of the most 
frequently used terms (sentences).

Then (ToS project), for each website read / interpret the ToS (or EULA) and 
map the terms to the previously defined terms (sentences). Adapt and 
iterate with the vocabulary. The first dozens would need to be done by the 
ToS project. After reaching a critical mass, websites might begin to 
configure / define their machine readable terms by themselves. 

Then users could configure their acceptable and unacceptable terms:

*ToS preferences for user Joe*
**
*
*
*What terms do you want add to your ToS terms blacklist?**Blacklist means 
that it's NOT ACCEPTABLE for you to agree to these or very similar terms*
   
   - * As user I have to pay money to the service provider.*
   - * the service provider has the right to sell my data*
   - * the service provider cooperates often with NSA / CIA / FBI / ....*
   - * We (the service provider) might change this ToS contract between you 
   and us, but we will not tell you about this. Despite of that, you have to 
   adhere to the changed contract immediately to all new terms.*
   - * This service may be used only by private home users (because I 
   intend to use it in the office as well)*
   - * EULA: install and use the software only on not more than 1 computer*

*
*
*What terms do you want to add to your ToS terms whitelist**Whitelist means 
that it's OK for you to agree to these or very similar terms*
   
   - * No warranty is given (in cases where the service is free of charge)*
   - * Use of the service only in accordance with the terms of this 
   Agreement.*
   - * The user may not disassemble, reverse compile, reverse engineer the 
   software*
   - * YOU agree that under no circumstances will (as an example) XYZ 
   Corporation be liable in any way for any errors or omissions in any 
   information, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of 
   the use of any information*
   - * YOU agree to indemnify, defend and hold Evernote Corporation, its 
   employees, members, managers, officers, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents or 
   other partners, harmless from any claims, liabilities, (including third 
   party claims and liabilities), demands, damages, losses, costs and 
   expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, etc....*


When the user wants to use a new web service (e.g surveymonkey.com) and 
needs to click "I accept" he might use a browser extension to check 
surverymonkey.com against his ToS settings ... and voila:  it tells him 
whether it's safe to click "I accept" or not -- without reading the ToS.

Bonus feature:
Have another page, let the user mark the webservices he often uses.  Let 
him click "check my previously accepted ToS (and EULA). And then big 
surprise ... the user recognizes the he accepted dozens of ToS (and EULAs) 
that were not acceptable according to his ToS preference settings.


What websites are you often using?check all those that apply:
   
   -  google.com
   -  GMail
   -  Facebook
   -  amazon.com
   -  wikipedia
   -  etc

What Software are you using?
   
   -  MS Office
   -  iTunes
   -  Skype
   -  Dropbox
   -  etc

Something like that might also be an incentive for the big websites to 
create ToS that pass more ToS preference checks.


-R
