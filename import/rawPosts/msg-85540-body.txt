Hi Sue,

We definitely had the plan to assess Wikipedia.  I actually remember
when the changes of terms was proposed on the website and I was
admirative of how much the process was welcoming to the user. In a
similar fashion, I also liked OpenStreetMap's approach very much (it is
quite similar).

I will not have time today to do this task. But if anybody here's
interested, you're welcome to contribute! Just post a thread on the
mailing list for each point that you think is relevant and deserved to
be mentioned, with a quote from the ToS and accompanying opinion or
analysis. 

If you're looking for which kinds of points we usually take into account
(although it's not definitive, feel free to invent new ones) have a look
at http://tos-dr.info/topics.html

Best,
Hugo
