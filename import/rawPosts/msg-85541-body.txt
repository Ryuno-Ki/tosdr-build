it can never legally replace your responsibility to (in theory) read
everything you agree to yourself. just like if you read a positive
film review but didn't like the film, or read a positive restaurant
review but get food poisoning, you can't go back to the review site
and complain about it. it is just a review, not a replacement of your
own autonomy as a decision maker.

there was another project that aims to do that, it lets you save a
copy of everything you sign. don't remember which one it was, right
now.

hopefully, yes!

That would never work. Natural language processing is a very hard AI
problem. Text can only be interpreted by humans and this cannot be
reliably automated.

Services could publish part of their terms in a machine-readable
format, yes. that would definitely be an advancement. defining the
vocab for that could be an interesting project in itself.

i'm not sure if this is even possible. there will always be parts of
the text that mean things that don't appear in the user's blacklist
and also not in the whitelist. also, you need to interpret the whole
ToS, and interpret it in the context of the service that is being
offer. sounds to me like something that's impossible to automate. at
least it's a lot harder than the problem we're looking at now.
