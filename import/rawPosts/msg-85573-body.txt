fyi (also for the newcomers), here is the mailing list for the eff
tosback2 project which will serve as our canonical data source for ToS
and PP texts, and also to notify us when changes happen and services
need to be re-rated:

https://mail1.eff.org/mailman/listinfo/tosback2
https://mail1.eff.org/pipermail/tosback2/2012-August/thread.html

Tosback2 tracks ToS documents and publishes diffs in a
machine-readable format (in the form of a git repo basically) whenever
they change. This awesome project is run by EFF, and ToS;DR is only
one of the projects that benefit from it; for instance researchers who
want to write scientific studies about consumer rights online (can)
also use it.


ciao,
Michiel
