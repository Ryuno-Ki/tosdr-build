Goodreads doesn't quite own your content, but they have a permanent right
to use it.

The standard TOS grants:

" a royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable, *perpetual, irrevocable,
non-exclusive, worldwide *license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, list
information regarding, edit, translate, distribute, publicly perform,
publicly display, and make derivative works of all such User Content and
your name, voice, and/or likeness ..."

Emphasis added. Non-exclusive, which means you can use it elsewhere. But
goodreads could bundle & sell reviews if they wanted. I don't see any
indication that they could prevent a reviewer from publishing their own
content elsewhere, although there doesn't seem to be any requirement that
they remove reviews at the reviewer's request.

Their TOU for writers requires:

"a royalty-free, sublicensable (solely as required to publish the Work in
connection with the Service), transferable (solely to a successor to
Goodreads=92 business), *revocable, non-exclusive, worldwide *license to us=
e,
reproduce, publish, list information regarding, edit, translate,
distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, and (for formatting
purposes or to conform to system requirements only) modify and make
derivative works of the Work and your name, voice, and/or likeness in
connection with the Work"...

(again; bolding added) but it's *revocable* by removing the work itself,
except for an allowance that it could be cached for a while. (Possibly a
very long while; Archive.org has Goodreads archives.)
