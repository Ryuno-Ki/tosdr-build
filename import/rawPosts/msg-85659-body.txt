Romanix: the Youluh project is focused on end users who don't want to read 
the terms of service before clicking, and it will also record all of the 
agreements you accept, so you can go back and review them later.  If you 
encounter a new ToS that is very similar to one you've agreed to in the 
past, it will tell you the differences, so you don't have to re-read 
everything.  This project is still under construction, and will be going 
through a Kickstarter to get funding, before it's fully launched.
