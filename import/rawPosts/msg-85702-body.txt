Hello - I'm interested in helping ToS;DR. Below is a small sample from
Sprint's Terms and Conditions (
https://shop2.sprint.com/en/legal/os_general_terms_conditions_popup.shtml
 ).

This is from "If Your Device Is Lost or Stolen" under "General terms and
conditions of service."

"Call us immediately if your Device is lost or stolen because you may be
responsible for usage charges before you notify us of the alleged loss or
theft. A lost or stolen Device does not reduce or remove your Term
Commitment. You will remain liable for any monthly recurring charges
associated with the Service on your Device after you notify us of the
alleged loss or theft. You agree to cooperate if we choose to investigate
the matter (provide facts, sworn statements, etc.). We may not waive any
Early Termination Fees if you choose to terminate Services as a result of
loss or theft of your Device."

This is a huge negative point as the account holder is still on the hook
for a monthly payment, even if they do not have their device and still have
to pay an ETF if they cancel service.


Please let me know how I can help more.
