Hi eheimburg,

First, no github bashing wanted from my part. I use their service for
tos-dr and apart from the fact that it's not free software, I have no
problem with it.

Le jeudi 09 ao=FBt 2012 =E0 11:47 -0700, eheimburg@gmail.com a =E9crit :
> Session cookies contain an "anonymous unique identifier" to let the

That's not exactly true. There is a difference in making users have
cookies for session by default, and making it a legal requirement to use
the service to accept cookies. So the thing I didn't like is really to
have it say "GitHub requires cookies"

> I'm having a very hard time understanding why GitHub alone gets

Now, the reason why for now maybe it's only GitHub is because we just
didn't have time to review more. Please contribute to help us fix that.
We don't want to appear like we want to single out GitHub for that.

One last thing, if you actually see the score (as you can see on
http://tos-dr.info/topics.html#cookies ) it's 5 out of 100. So it's
actually so low that it nearly doesn't affect GitHub's class. (which
mostly have to do with the fact that "Your account can be suspended and
your data deleted any time" for no reason) If you want to discuss the
point about extreme suspension of the account, feel free to post at
https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tosdr/hI5Too_uDVk/lr2QHzzhhpUJ

Best,
Hugo
