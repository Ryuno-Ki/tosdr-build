Thanks for the reply, I didn't know how big a factor it was in the rating.=

I think the disconnect is that GitHub mentions that they require cookies in=
 their privacy policy, not their terms of service. In this case it's really=
 a statement of fact, not a right you're giving up: the website literally d=
oesn't work if you turn off cookies. You can't log in. (Same with Facebook,=
 though it doesn't choose to mention this fact.)=20

Session cookies are pretty harmless, and since they indicate that they aren=
't using third-party cookies, their cookie policy seems to be the same poli=
cy as Wikipedia, but Wikipedia gets a thumbs-up instead of a thumbs-down.

[ Also, a casual observer, I just assumed that things with a lot of down-vo=
tes were worse than things with fewer entries. If different things are weig=
hted very differently, I think it would be good to have some way to tell wh=
at's important at a glance. ]

Anyway, I love the idea behind the site and hope it keeps growing!
