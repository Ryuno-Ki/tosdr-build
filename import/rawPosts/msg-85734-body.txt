welcome to the list!

yeah i agree it's annoying when that happens to you, but i don't know
how else they could implement an Early Termination Fee. the contract
fee is essentially a loan for the phone you get at the beginning. if
whenever you're bored of your commitment you say 'oh i lost my phone,
i will stop paying now' then that would be too easy. the ETF is
basically a payment from you for the value of the phone they gave you,
right? if you have a car loan then it also doesn't get cancelled when
the car gets stolen, i think?

do you know of any phone companies that do not have this clause? maybe
with a sort of insurance included in the deal?

just brainstorming :)

cheers,
Michiel
