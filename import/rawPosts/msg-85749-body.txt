I'm curious; why such negative treatment of this term? As far as I know,
it's difficult-to-infeasible to eradicate all user content from a large
distributed service, particularly one that backs up to tape. This TOS may
only recognize that fact. I'd be very surprised if many other large
services can actually claim to have eradicated all user data when the user
leaves the service, and they shouldn't get a free ride just because they
elide that from their TOS.
