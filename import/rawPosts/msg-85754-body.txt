yes, that's true, and the 'time enough to allow our services to
update' sounds fair to me. but this phrase is still funny:

>> we may retain an archived copy [...] for legitimate business purposes

maybe 'archived' implies that it's on a backup tape but not accessible
through the production environment? what are business purposes? if
they actively retain a copy for a specific purpose then that's not the
same technical difficulties in the deletion of the data.

they could have written something like 'your data will still be on our
archive system, but will not be accessible anymore by anybody in any
way except employees of ours who signed an NDA doing server admin
tasks, and law enforcement officers with a warrant'.

how do you interpret the term 'legitimate business purposes'? Maybe we
should contact their support department and ask them for clarification
about this clause
