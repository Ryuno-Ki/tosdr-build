Subject: [bad] Google Chrome now forces you to use Chrome Web Store as only choice

when you install packaged apps from a web app store into a browser,
it's a bit like installing an app on a phone. Apple is already only
allowing only Apple App Store apps onto iOS devices, but i think (i
haven't actually tried this) Google is allowing alternatives to
Android Market on Android. Also, if you run Microsoft Windows on your
computer, then you can install any software you like, wherever it
comes from. You don't need permission from Microsoft to install
software you choose on your device.

That's why iOS can be called a 'closed platform' while Android and
Windows are 'open platforms'. Anyway, for their Chrome platform was
always open until about a month ago, and then they seem to have gone
with the 'closed platform'.

in theory, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Mozilla and Microsoft could (in
the future) offer packaged web app stores to their customers, and it
would be nice if they would be compatible with the Chrome browser,
with the Chrome OS operating system, and with the Chromebook device.
And they used to be, but now they're not anymore.

Ironically, their statement
http://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/?p=crx_warning  about this
change says:

"The updated installation process [...] gives you more control over
the extensions you're adding to Chrome."

i think what they meant to say was 'gives *us* more control' :)

i asked Google about this but they didn't really reply (yet); see this
thread on the chrome web store forum
https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/chromium-apps/AZcMm413xww
for the discussion. enterprise customers are apparently not affected,
only direct end users, and there is a work-around (download the app to
a file, then drag-and-drop the file to Chrome's extensions tab) but
that's cumbersome.


ciao,
Michiel
