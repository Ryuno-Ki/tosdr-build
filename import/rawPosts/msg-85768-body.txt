Buckle up, this is kinda long. :\*

*Each data set has a bracketed number [x] for reference in discussion. Some=
=20
data sets will probably need to be combined together. My opinion is in=20
brackets (good) (bad) (note).*

For those unfamiliar with Steam*, they primarily sell digital downloads of=
=20
video games. They have user profiles and social interaction similar to any=
=20
other social media website. They will also soon be selling productivity=20
software (MS Office, etc.) and have a cloud storage service for pictures=20
and documents.*

Privacy Policy*
http://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/

*[1]* (good) Steam's PP is a reasonable length, the page is readable, and=
=20
is split into sections with intelligible headings.

*[2]* (Is this something ToS;DR cares about?) An individual's information=
=20
that isn't personally identifiable can be shared without restriction. This=
=20
mainly affects their randomly sampled hardware surveys I believe.

*"Individual information" is information about a user or user=92s machine=
=20
that is presented in a form distinguishable from information relating to=20
other users but not in a form that personally identifies any user or=20
enables the recipient to communicate directly with any user. Valve may=20
share aggregate and individual information with other parties without=20
restriction.*

*[3]* (good) No sharing personal info with 3rd parties for marketing=20
purposes.

*Valve will not share personally identifying information with third parties=
=20
for marketing purposes. *

*[4]* (good) Using your real name is optional.

*In some situations, personally identifiable information that users input=
=20
in connection with their use of Steam may be available to other users of=20
Steam. For example, during the creation of a Steam account, Valve collects=
=20
a user's email address and username, and at the user's option, first and=20
last name. Some of this information is searchable and available to other=20
users within Steam. Valve has no obligation to keep private personally=20
identifiable information that a user makes available to other users via=20
Steam or other Valve software, such as in multiplayer chat or other public=
=20
functions. *

*[5]* (note) No promise for transparency on law enforcement or government=
=20
requests.

*Valve may release personally identifiable information to comply with court=
=20
orders or laws that require us to disclose such information. In the event=
=20
of a reorganization, sale or merger we may transfer personally identifiable=
=20
information to the relevant third party.*

*[6]* (good!) Can request review and/or removal of personally identifiable=
=20
info.

*If you are concerned about the accuracy of personally identifiable=20
information maintained by Valve or wish to review, access, amend or correct=
=20
it, or would like your personally identifiable information removed from=20
Valve's records or otherwise deactivated, please contact us here. We may=20
decline requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate=
=20
technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or are extremely=20
impractical.*

*
Subscriber Agreement*
http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/

*[7]* (bad!) Valve has an unlimited use license on all user generated=20
content without need for attribution. This survives termination of the=20
agreement. Sounds pretty much the same as Facebook.

Section 6
*Subject to the Valve privacy policy referenced in Section 1 above, as=20
applicable, you expressly grant Valve and its affiliates the complete and=
=20
irrevocable right to use, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from,=
=20
distribute, transmit, broadcast, and otherwise communicate, and publicly=20
display and perform the User Generated Information and derivative works=20
thereof in any form, anywhere, with or without attribution to you, and=20
without any notice or compensation to you of any kind.
*
*[8]* (bad) Defend and indemnify Valve. Survives termination of the=20
agreement.

Section 8
*You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Valve, its licensors, and=
=20
its and their affiliates from all liabilities, claims and expenses,=20
including attorneys' fees, that arise from or in connection with breach of=
=20
this Agreement or the use of Steam or any Subscription, by you or any=20
person(s) using your Account, or from or in connection with any User=20
Generated Information, or the creation, distribution, promotion and use of=
=20
any Mods or Derivative Works, created or provided by you or any person(s)=
=20
using your Account. Valve reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume=
=20
the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to=20
indemnification by you. In that event, you shall have no further obligation=
=20
to provide indemnification to Valve in that matter. This Section regarding=
=20
Indemnification shall survive termination of this Agreement.*

*[9]* (good) Will notify users via email or Steam client when subscriber=20
agreement is changed - agreement is auto-accepted 30 days from notification=
=20
if account isn't canceled.
*[10]* (bad) If you choose to cancel your account because of an agreement=
=20
change all subscriptions (purchased games) are canceled and no refund given=
.

Section 9
*Valve may amend this Agreement (including any Subscription Terms or Rules=
=20
of Use) at any time in its sole discretion. If Valve amends the Agreement,=
=20
such amendment shall be effective thirty (30) days after your receiving=20
notice of the amended Agreement, either via e-mail or as a notification=20
within the Software. You can view the Agreement at any time at=20
http://www.steampowered.com/. Your failure to cancel your Account, or cease=
=20
use of the Subscription(s) affected by the amendment, within thirty (30)=20
days after receiving notification of the amendment, will constitute your=20
acceptance of the amended terms. If you don't agree to the amendments or to=
=20
any of the terms in this Agreement, your only remedy is to cancel your=20
Account or to cease use of the affected Subscription(s). Valve shall not=20
have any obligation to refund any fees that may have accrued to your=20
Account before cancellation of your Account or cessation of use of any=20
Subscription, nor shall Valve have any obligation to prorate any fees in=20
such circumstances.*

*[11]* (good) A user can voluntarily cancel their account at any time.=20
*[10]* (bad) Subscriptions (purchased games) cancelled because of account=
=20
cancellation can't be transferred or refunded.

Section 10:B
*You may cancel your Account at any time. You may cease use of a=20
Subscription at any time or, if you choose, you may request that we=20
terminate your access to a Subscription. However, Subscriptions are not=20
transferable, and even if your access to a Subscription for a particular=20
game or application is terminated, the original activation key will not be=
=20
able to be registered to any other account, even if the game or application=
=20
was purchased in a retail store. Access to Subscriptions purchased as a=20
part of a pack or bundle cannot be terminated individually, termination of=
=20
access to one game within the bundle will result in termination of access=
=20
to all games purchased in the pack will be removed from the account. Your=
=20
cancellation of an Account, or your cessation of use of any Subscription or=
=20
request that access to a Subscription be terminated, will not entitle you=
=20
to any refund, including of any Subscription fees.*

*[12]* (bad) Valve can cancel your account at any time for any reason.
*[10] *(bad) Subscriptions (purchased games) cancelled because of account=
=20
cancellation can't be transferred or refunded.

Section 10:C
*Valve may cancel your Account or any particular Subscription(s) at any=20
time. In the event that your Account or a particular Subscription is=20
terminated or cancelled by Valve for a violation of this Agreement or=20
improper or illegal activity, no refund, including of any Subscription=20
fees, will be granted.*


*[15]* (note) Non-EU subscribers: Legal action happens in Washington state.=
=20
EU subscribers: Legal action happens in Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

Section 11
*For Subscribers other than EU Subscribers:*
*You agree that this Agreement shall be deemed to have been made and=20
executed in the State of Washington, and any dispute arising hereunder=20
shall be resolved in accordance with the law of Washington. Subject to=20
Section 12 (Dispute Resolution/Binding Arbitration/Class Action Waiver)=20
below, you agree that any claim asserted in any legal proceeding by you=20
against Valve shall be commenced and maintained exclusively in any state or=
=20
federal court located in King County, Washington, having subject matter=20
jurisdiction with respect to the dispute between the parties and you hereby=
=20
consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts. In any dispute=20
arising under this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to=20
attorneys' fees and expenses.

For EU Subscribers:
You agree that this Agreement shall be deemed to have been made and=20
executed in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and that it is subject to the=20
laws of Luxembourg, excluding the law of conflicts and the Convention on=20
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). However, where the=20
laws of Luxembourg provide a lower degree of consumer protection than the=
=20
laws of your country of residence, the consumer protection laws of your=20
country shall prevail. In any dispute arising under this Agreement, the=20
prevailing party will be entitled to attorneys' fees and expenses.*

*[16]* (bad) Lawsuit and class action waiver. Binding arbitration. Survives=
=20
termination of agreement.

Section 12
*YOU AND VALVE AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US IN=20
INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION. THAT INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, ANY=
=20
CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO: (i) ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP=20
BETWEEN US; (ii) THIS AGREEMENT; OR (iii) YOUR USE OF STEAM, YOUR ACCOUNT=
=20
OR THE SOFTWARE. IT APPLIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS ARE BASED IN=
=20
CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, UNFAIR COMPETITION, MISREPRESENTATION OR=20
ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY.

However, this Section does not apply to the following types of claims or=20
disputes, which you or Valve may bring in any court with jurisdiction: (i)=
=20
claims of infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights,=20
including such claims seeking injunctive relief; and (ii) claims related to=
=20
or arising from any alleged unauthorized use, piracy or theft.

This Section does not prevent you from bringing your dispute to the=20
attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if=
=20
the law allows, seek relief from us for you.

[...]YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND VALVE ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO SUE IN=20
COURT AND TO HAVE A TRIAL BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.

YOU AND VALVE AGREE NOT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR=20
REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR COLLECTIVE=20
ARBITRATION, EVEN IF AAA's PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD OTHERWISE ALLOW ONE.=
=20
THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY=20
SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM.*
