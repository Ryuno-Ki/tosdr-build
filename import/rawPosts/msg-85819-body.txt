wow, awesome work! we'll mark up the JSON asap so that it will appear
on the front page. all my reactions here are imho (in my humble
opinion) and ianal (i am not a lawyer), but hopefully they still help
the discussion of how we want to rate Steam:

i counted 6 good points and 5 bad ones in the list. do you have an
idea for a preliminary overall rating? probably either a C or a D,
then? we should look at the others we have rated and crystalize out a
rough scale of points & weights to rating, so we can make sure we're
doing it fairly.

yes, I would say we definitely care about; the information may not in
itself be enough to contact a person, but it easily becomes
identifiable if someone buys steam data and e.g. also buys facebook
data, and correlates them.

isn't that in contradiction with 'valve may share any individual
information with other parties without restriction'?

about your point [10], we saw a similar point with that phone company
that doesn't let you cancel your minimum contract when you lose your
phone. you pay up front for a set period of time, and you're committed
to that. i don't think that is in itself necessarily evil, is it? you
can judge for yourself how much minimal contract you want to take on.
a lot of services also offer a free trial period during which you
don't pay yet and/or can still cancel. it seems to be more part of the
definition of the product they sell than of the ToS of that product? i
mean, if we define their product as a prepaid subscription for a
predefined period (rather than, say, pay-per-use), then within that
frame it sound reasonable that they don't buy back your left overs
from you when you decided halfway through your cake that you don't
want to eat the rest of it. imho.

i find the concept of a "lawsuit waiver" so ridiculous... saying you
won't use/follow the law between you and another party sounds like
obstruction of justice / contempt of court to me; isn't it my duty as
a citizen of a country or something to recognize and use its national
legal system where appropriate? i have probably agreed to lawsuit
waivers without knowing it in the past by checking checkboxes. :(
thanks to you, Steam's one now stands in broad daylight... awesome
job!
