In Steam's case I think the "individual but not personally identifiable=20
data" mainly applies to data they've collected that is individualized but=
=20
not connected to your personally identifiable data in any way - eg their=20
hardware survey which creates a profile of the hardware on your computer=20
and stores this separate from your personal profile. That said, if they=20
technically have the power to do more sinister things with it there's no=20
guarantee they won't. I would hope that any data that could be matched up=
=20
to data from somewhere else would be considered "personally identifiable".=

No, because the individual info can't be connected to you in any way, even=
=20
by Steam itself... theoretically.=20

I don't think it is necessarily evil, no. Given the nature of the service=
=20
it's kind of something they have to do. From a legal perspective (from my=
=20
very limited legal knowledge) you're totally right.

On the flip side, people approach buying games on Steam in the same way=20
they approach buying games physically at a retail location like Gamestop,=
=20
and so from that perspective it might surprise someone that they could pay=
=20

canceled account. Gamestop doesn't take all the boxed games you bought back=

physical equivalent to buying minutes for your phone.

They did state that if you live outside the US that the lawsuit waiver=20
probably doesn't apply to you, and while arbitration does provide an=20
alternative method of dispute resolution it also really limits the power=20
that consumers have in ways that the standard court system does not.
