 Netflix also has a DVD Terms & Conditions for DVD subscribers. I read this=

and there wasn't anything interesting in it =96 just an explanation of how=
=20
the DVD service works.


 *[1]* ToU and PP pages are organized and formatted well. Index at the top=

 *[4] *(bad) Netflix discloses personal info if requested (not court=20
ordered) by law enforcement, with no notifications.


 *Netflix also reserves the right to disclose personal information if we=20
reasonably believe that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such=20

 *With respect to your personal information, you can request access and=20
that we correct or delete this personal information by emailing your=20
request to privacy@netflix.com. *=20


 *[7] *(bad) Cookies required. This is probably more of a functional issue=
=20
than a privacy issue.


 *The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to=20
prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser=20
notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies=20
altogether. If your browser is set to not accept any cookies, you will not=

be able to use the Netflix service or website. *=20


 *[8]* (bad?) Netflix uses 3rd party advertisers that use tracking cookies=

Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your information and=20
cannot assume liability for improper access to it.*=20


 *[10] *(bad) No notifications about policy changes. Agreeing to the PP and=

ToU also means you agree to any changes in the future.


 *As we update and expand our services, we may make changes to this policy.=
=20

 *Terms of Use*

 *[10] *(bad) Notifications about ToU changes not required.


 *Netflix reserves the right, from time to time, with or without notice to=

you, to change these Terms of Use, including the Privacy Policy and EULA,=
=20
in our sole and absolute discretion. *=20


 *[11] *(good) Can cancel at any time.


 *You may cancel your Netflix membership at any time. WE DO NOT PROVIDE=20
REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR ANY PARTIAL-MONTH MEMBERSHIP PERIODS OR UNWATCHED=20
MOVIES OR TV SHOWS. *=20


 *[12] *(bad) Netflix can terminate your account for any reason without=20
notice.


 *We reserve the right to terminate or restrict your use of our service,=20
without notice, for any or no reason whatsoever. *=20


 *[13] *(bad) Netflix has an unlimited license to user generated content or=
=20
feedback without attribution. In the context of the service this is not a=
=20
big deal to me personally. Netflix isn't a place I go to share photos or=20
interact socially.


 *Netflix is free to use any comments, information, ideas, concepts,=20
reviews, or techniques or any other material contained in any communication=
=20
you may send to us ("Feedback"), including responses to questionnaires or=

user interfaces, without further compensation, acknowledgement or payment=
=20
to you for any purpose whatsoever including, but not limited to,=20
developing, manufacturing and marketing products and creating, modifying or=
=20
improving the Netflix service. Furthermore, by posting any Feedback on our=
=20
site, submitting Feedback to us, or in responding to questionnaires, you=20
grant us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free irrevocable=20
license, including the right to sublicense such right, and right to=20
display, use, reproduce or modify the Feedback submitted in any media,=20
software or technology of any kind now existing or developed in the future.=
=20
*=20


 *[14]* (bad) Lawsuit and class action waiver. Arbitration agreement.=20
Survives termination of ToU agreement.


 *You and Netflix agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out=
=20
of or relating in any way to the Netflix service, including our website,=20
user interfaces, these Terms of Use and this Arbitration Agreement, shall=
=20
be determined by binding arbitration instead of in courts of general=20
jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.=20
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows=20
for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited=20
review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a=
=20
court can award. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Use, the=20
U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of=
=20
this provision, and that you and Netflix are each waiving the right to a=20
trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration=20
provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination=
=20
of your Netflix membership. *=20


 *YOU AND NETFLIX AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY=
=20
IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER=
=20
IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. *=20

dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way
to the Netflix service, including our website, user interfaces, these
Terms of Use and this Arbitration Agreement, shall be determined by
binding arbitration instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration
uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more
limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited
review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief
that a court can award. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of
Use, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
enforcement of this provision, and that you and Netflix are each
waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class
action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this
Agreement and the termination of your Netflix membership. </i>
