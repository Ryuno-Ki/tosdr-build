*Wikipedia ToU & PP*

*[1]* (bad) No links to ToU or PP on index. Had to navigate to a sub page=
=20
to get links in footer. This is really more a note to Wikipedia rather than=
=20
worthy of inclusion on ToS;DR.

*[2]* (good) ToU formatted with excellent summary section. Both ToU and PP=
=20
have an index with links to #anchors down the page.

*Privacy Policy*
http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy

*[3]* (good) Use of real name not required.

*Anyone with Internet access (and not otherwise restricted from doing so)=
=20
may edit the publicly editable pages of these sites with or without logging=
=20
in as a registered user.=20
...
The Foundation does not require editors to register with a project. Anyone=
=20
can edit without logging in with a username, in which case they will be=20
identified by network IP address. Users that do register are identified by=
=20
their chosen username.=20
*
*[4]* (good) Personal info is only used for running the service.

*The Foundation limits the collection of personally identifiable user data=
=20
to purposes which serve the well-being of its projects (list of uses=20
related to preventing abuse).
...
To provide site statistics. The Foundation statistically samples raw log=20
data from users' visits. These logs are used to produce the site statistics=
=20
pages; the raw log data is not made public.=20
To solve technical problems. Log data may be examined by developers in the=
=20
course of solving technical problems and in tracking down badly-behaved web=
=20
spiders that overwhelm the site.=20
*
*[5]* (note) User's IP may be used as permanently available public=20
identification. Better privacy available in form of being a registered user=
.

*For editors who do not log in, the IP address used is publicly and=20
permanently credited as the author of the edit. It may be possible for a=20
third party to identify the author from this IP address in conjunction with=
=20
other information available. Logging in with a registered username allows=
=20
for better preservation of privacy.=20
...
Edits to Project pages are identified with the username or network IP=20
address of the editor, and editing history is aggregated by author in a=20
contribution list. Such information will be available permanently on the=20
projects.=20
*
*[6]* (good) Cookies optional if just viewing pages. Cookies used for=20
logins/edits.

*The sites set a temporary session cookie on a visitor's computer whenever=
=20
a Project page is visited. Readers who do not intend to log in or edit may=
=20
deny this cookie; it will be deleted at the end of the browser's session.=
=20
More cookies may be set when one logs in to maintain logged-in status. If=
=20
one saves a user name or password in one's browser, that information will=
=20
be saved for up to 30 days, and this information will be resent to the=20
server on every visit to the same Project. Contributors using a public=20
machine who do not wish to show their username to future users of the=20
machine should clear these cookies after use.
*
*[7]* (good) Personal info disclosed to law enforcement by court order=20
only. User is notified.

*As a general principle, the access to, and retention of, personally=20
identifiable data in all projects should be minimal and should be used only=
=20
internally to serve the well-being of the projects. Occasionally, however,=
=20
the Foundation may receive a subpoena or other compulsory request from a=20
law-enforcement agency or a court or equivalent government body that=20
requests the disclosure of information about a registered user, and may be=
=20
compelled by law to comply with the request. In the event of such a legally=
=20
compulsory request, the Foundation will attempt to notify the affected user=
=20
within three business days after the arrival of such subpoena by sending a=
=20
notice by email to the email address (if any) that the affected user has=20
listed in his or her user preferences.=20
*

*Terms of Use*
http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_use

*[8]* (note?) Users are legally responsible for their own contributions and=
=20
actions.

Section 1.b
*You are responsible for your own actions: You are legally responsible for=
=20
your edits and contributions on Wikimedia Projects, so for your own=20
protection you should exercise caution and avoid contributing any content=
=20
that may result in criminal or civil liability under any applicable laws.=
=20
For clarity, applicable law includes at least the laws of the United States=
=20
of America. Although we may not agree with such actions, we warn editors=20
and contributors that authorities may seek to apply other country laws to=
=20
you, including local laws where you live or where you view or edit content.=
=20
WMF generally cannot offer any protection, guarantee, immunity or=20
indemnification.=20
*
*[9]* (good) User contributions licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 and GFDL.

Section 7.a
*Text to which you hold the copyright: When you submit text to which you=20
hold the copyright, you agree to license it under:=20

GNU Free Documentation License (=93GFDL=94) (unversioned, with no invariant=
=20
sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts).=20
*
*[10]* (good) You may cancel at any time.

*Though we hope you will stay and continue to contribute to the Projects,=
=20
you can stop using our services any time.=20
*
*[11]* (note) Jurisdiction in California.

*If you seek to file a legal claim against us, you agree to file and=20
resolve it exclusively in a state or federal court located in San Francisco=
=20
County, California. You also agree that the laws of the State of California=
=20
and, to the extent applicable, the laws of the United States of America=20
will govern these Terms of Use, as well as any legal claim that might arise=
=20
between you and us (without reference to conflict of laws principles). You=
=20
agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of, and agree that venue is=20
proper in, the courts located in San Francisco County, California, in any=
=20
legal action or proceeding relating to us or these Terms of Use.=20
*
*[12]* (good) Community included in modifications to ToU. Notifications=20
provided via website.

*Just as the Wikimedia community's input is essential for the growth and=20
maintenance of the Projects, we believe that community input is essential=
=20
for these Terms of Use to properly serve our users. It is also essential=20
for a fair contract. Therefore, we will provide these Terms of Use, as well=
=20
as any substantial future revisions of these Terms of Use, to the community=
=20
for comment at least thirty (30) days before the end of the comment period.=
=20
...
Because it may be necessary to modify these Terms of Use from time to time,=
=20
we will provide notice of such modifications and the opportunity to comment=
=20
via the Project websites, and via a notification on WikimediaAnnounce-L. *
