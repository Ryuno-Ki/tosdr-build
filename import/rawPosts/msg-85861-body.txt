i now marked this up into
https://github.com/unhosted/ToS-DR/tree/gh-pages/points - all the
points starting with "rhykox7XUfs" are from this thread.

we already had one data point on Steam from another thread (you can
click 'discuss' for each point from the popup to see where they come
from).

you can see the result here: http://tos-dr.info/#steam

i gave weight 50 to most of your points - in general i just tried to
codify the information from the text into json. let me know if there
are any errors!

Ciao,
Michiel
