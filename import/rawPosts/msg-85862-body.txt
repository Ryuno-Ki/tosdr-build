In Wordpress.com's ToS I'm seeing:

*Changes. *Automattic reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify 
> or replace any part of this Agreement. It is your responsibility to check 
> this Agreement periodically for changes. Your continued use of or access to 
> the Website following the posting of any changes to this Agreement

> shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

 
What I'm reading out of this is:

   1. We can make changes anytime
   2. We won't notify you of changes
   3. Your responsible for noticing if we change anything
   4. Accessing the site (presumably even to view the ToS) indicates 
   acceptance of new terms

Sounds like a very bad policy to me, even though I see it in a lot of a 
sites I don't think that makes it more acceptable. You can blindly enter a 
new ToS that gives Wordpress rights to your content without ever knowing in 
this scenario, and it makes their entire service into a potential quicksand.
