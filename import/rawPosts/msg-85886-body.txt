Thanks Pants for your contributions, we've got several feedback from
people who wanted us to rate Steam!

[1] easy to read >

I do not agree. The policy may not be too long, but it's not doing any
real efforts to make it intelligible. Compared to 500px, SoundCloud,
Tumblr, Wikipedia or OpenStreetMap, this is on a totally different
scale. So I'd just delete this point as it is IMHO not any different
from any standard bad practice. (Or did I miss that Steam makes a point
of providing a good plain-English summary upon subscription?)

[2] Randomly sampled hardware survey

I would need more details. What kind of information is that? It is
specified it can but "about a user or user's machine" and it can be
shared not only as "aggregate" but also as "individual information". It
is clear that "individual" information makes a user or a users' machine
identifiable from other users (they say "distinguishable"). 

How isn't that "personally identifiable"? We need more context and more
evidence to assess this. (I don't see any occurrence that it would be
only from hardware surveys, bug reports and hardware related things are
described later below as being associated with personal information).

[3] no share of personnally identifiable info for marketing

Well. Should this be considered "good"? I mean, it should be standard in
my opinion, don't you think? I'll merge it with the point below as a
detail about personal info.

[5] Removed the part about merger. duplicates from point
eff-back-transparency-data-no (I just alerted the EFF about this one,
see https://www.eff.org/pages/who-has-your-back#transparency)

[6] That's good, although i am not exactly sure how much of it is a
legal requirement any way :)

[7] License

Can you elaborate what kind of content is licensed? It only mentions
User Generated Information. I am not sure copyrighted works, or
sufficient contributions would fall in the scope of this license. I
don't know enough about steam, so what is typically the material being
licensed? Are we talking pictures, texts or are we talking "gaming
points", database stuff, etc? Thank you. (I remove the point until
decided, it will be moved to the points2/ directory)

[8] It is a complicated clause. I would create a separate thread for it.

[9][10] Changes and no refund policy

I think this is fine, 30 days is good. About the refund policy, is there
anything looking negative to you? I'll create a neutral point: no refund
policy, because it's good to know for the user anyway.

I made other slight modifications to align to other services' rating.
