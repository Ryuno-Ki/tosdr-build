In reply to Hugo:

*[1]* - You're right that the subscriber agreement is pretty much a mess. 
The privacy policy on the other hand was readable. Overall it's a wash, and 
I agree with you removing this point.

*[2]* - This is an example of their latest hardware survey: 
http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/

It's hard to say what else could be included here. I've submitted a support 
ticket to Steam asking for clarification on this, and also the difference 
between cancelling an account and deleting an account.

*[5]* - I didn't know when I wrote that the difference between transparency 
and notifying the user. They promise neither.

*[7]* - Upon researching this further it is not as big an issue as I 
thought. Steam has a mod hosting service called Steam Workshop (art and 
code in mods is copyrightable), and this has its own Contribution Agreement 
which changes this section to require attribution. This section would 
mainly affect written reviews, written communication, and any copyrightable 
pictures/videos that you upload to your Steam Cloud storage (game 
screenshots/videos are not copyrightable). This will be something to keep 
an eye on, however, when Steam starts encouraging people to save documents 
to their Steam Cloud storage as they begin selling "creativity to 
productivity" software next month.

*[8]* - I'll make a separate thread for this. Netflix had this same 
statement so I'll include them in it too.
