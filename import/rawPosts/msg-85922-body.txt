The Steam Subscriber agreement states:
*You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Valve, its licensors, and 
its and their affiliates from all liabilities, claims and expenses, 
including attorneys' fees, that arise from or in connection with breach of 
this Agreement or the use of Steam or any Subscription, by you or any 
person(s) using your Account, or from or in connection with any User 
Generated Information, or the creation, distribution, promotion and use of 
any Mods or Derivative Works, created or provided by you or any person(s) 
using your Account. Valve reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume 
the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to 
indemnification by you. In that event, you shall have no further obligation 
to provide indemnification to Valve in that matter. This Section regarding 
Indemnification shall survive termination of this Agreement.* 

Basically, if Valve gets sued for something you did you have to pay any 
costs they incur. This does seem to cover any game mods people release on 
Steam Workshop.
