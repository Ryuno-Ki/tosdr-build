Adding to Michiel's point:  retaining a license to use 'for legitimate busi=
ness purpose' in a business to business transaction would elicit immediate =
'red flags' because the language is vague and very broad.  In that context =
a discussion and revision would take place to more accurately reflect how t=
hat information is to be used.  In the case of TOS such language is particu=
larly problematic because:
1.  This is business to customer context where the drafter really ought to =
consider the fact that terms ordinarily not acceptable to business are quit=
e likely to be problematic for non-business;
2.   It's a contract of adhesion (non-negotiable take it or leave it agreem=
ent) so no opportunity to raise concerns, clarification and revise.

As pointed out below, providing transparency at a minimum with respect to u=
se is a good starting point.  I expect that as this project develops organi=
zations seeking to provide more open and balanced models will be willing to=
 limit their future use of content, perhaps even committing to its return a=
nd destruction when customer requests. =20
