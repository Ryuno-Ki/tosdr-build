Ok, I went through and made a summary of what I feel are the important=20
parts in the ToC.
>
>
*Good - ETF is reduced monthly*
"The ETF is prorated and is calculated by taking the months remaining on=20
your Agreement times $20 for Advanced Devices, with a maximum of $350, and=
=20
minimum of $100. For all other devices, the prorated ETF is calculated by=
=20
taking the months remaining times $10 with a maximum of $200 and minimum of=
=20
$50."

*Info - There are activation fees and sometimes deposits*
"Up to a $36 activation fee applies to new activations, certain service=20
plan changes or upgrades of phones or devices. A reconnect fee of up to $36=
=20
may apply to reestablish service on all accounts that have=20
been disconnected for nonpayment or discontinuous of service. A deposit, in=
=20
most instances between $50 and $750 (but sometimes up to $1000), may be=20
required per line to establish service."

*Bad - User may be on the hook for a stolen phone*
"Call us immediately if your Device is lost or stolen because you may be=20
responsible for usage charges before you notify us of the alleged loss or=
=20
theft. A lost or stolen Device does not reduce or remove your Term=20
Commitment. You will remain liable for any monthly recurring charges=20
associated with the Service on your Device after you notify us of the=20
alleged loss or theft. You agree to cooperate if we choose to investigate=
=20
the matter (provide facts, sworn statements, etc.). We may not waive any=20
Early Termination Fees if you choose to terminate Services as a result of=
=20
loss or theft of your Device."

*Good - Can leave contract if terms change*
"We may change any part of the Agreement at any time, including, but not=20
limited to, rates, charges, how we calculate charges, discounts, coverage,=
=20
technologies used to provide services, or your terms of Service. We will=20
provide you notice of material changes=97and we may provide you notice of=
=20
non-material changes=97in a manner consistent with this Agreement (see=20
"Providing Notice To Each Other Under The Agreement" section). If a change=
=20
we make to the Agreement is material and has a material adverse effect on=
=20
Services under your Term Commitment, you may terminate each line of Service=
=20
materially affected without incurring an Early Termination Fee only if you:=
=20
(a) call us within 30 days after the effective date of the change; and (b)=
=20
specifically advise us that you wish to cancel Services because of a=20
material change to the Agreement that we have made. If you do not cancel=20
Service within 30 days of the change, an Early Termination Fee will apply=
=20
if you terminate Services before the end of any applicable Term Commitment.=
"

*Alert - Service can be ended at any time*
"We can, without notice, suspend or terminate any Service at any time for=
=20
any reason. For example, we can suspend or terminate any Service for the=20
following: (a) late payment; (b) exceeding an Account Spending Limit; (c)=
=20
harassing/threatening/abusing/offending our employees or agents; (d)=20
providing false or inaccurate information; (e) interfering with our=20
operations; (f) using/suspicion of using Services in any manner restricted=
=20
by or inconsistent with the Agreement and Policies; (g) breaching, failing=
=20
to follow, or abusing the Agreement or Policies; (h) providing false,=20
inaccurate, dated, or unverifiable identification or credit information or=
=20
becoming insolvent or bankrupt; (i) modifying a Device from its=20
manufacturer specifications (for example, rooting the device); (j) failing=
=20
to use our Services for an extended period of time; (k) failing to maintain=
=20
an active Device in connection with our Services; or (l) if we believe the=
=20
action protects our interests, any customer's interests, or our networks."

*Bad - Entered into mandatory arbitration *
"We each agree to arbitrate all Disputes between us, on an individual=20
basis, not on a class-wide or consolidated basis. This agreement to=20
arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. In arbitration, there's no=
=20
judge or jury. However, just as a court would, the arbitrator must honor=20
the terms and limitations in the Agreement and can award damages and=20
relief, including any attorneys' fees authorized by law. The arbitrator's=
=20
decision and award is final and binding, with some exceptions under the=20
Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), and judgment on the award may be entered=
=20
in any court with jurisdiction."

"No Class Actions
TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON=
=20
A CLASSWIDE BASIS; THAT IS, TO EITHER JOIN A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY=20
OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY OR ASSERT A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON=20
BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION, OR OTHER PROCEEDING."
"No Trial By Jury
TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN=
=20
ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION, OR OTHER PROCEEDING."
