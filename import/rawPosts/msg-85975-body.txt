The *reduced ETF* gets +1 in my book. I'm not sure how common that is among=
=20
carriers, but it should be industry standard.

How to handle* fees inside a ToS* is tricky. If they're hiding activation=
=20
fees in the terms that you don't know about until you get your bill, then I=
=20
think ToS;DR should put some sort of "Fees hidden in ToS" warning. If=20
they're up front about things like activation fees and show it in your=20
total as you check out with a new phone plan then I don't see any reason=20
ToS;DR should include them.

About being *on the hook for a stolen phone* - I thought about the ideal=20
scenario here, and the 'best' solution I could come up with is removing any=
=20
overage charges after the date/time that you say the phone was stolen in a=
=20
filed police report because it is perjury to lie in a police report. The=20
next best solution I could come up with is the way they do it, which is to=
=20
remove overage charges from the time you call them. You are still stuck=20
paying your normal monthly fee while the phone is replaced, but this is the=
=20
same if you break your phone - both are not really the phone company's=20
fault so you still pay your normal monthly fees. Honestly, I'm kind of fine=
=20
with Sprint's entire lost or stolen policy. My dad had his phone stolen on=
=20
vacation once, and it did not turn out nearly as well as it is laid out in=
=20
this policy (different carrier).

Sprint also has an *indemnification policy*:
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Sprint and our subsidiaries,=20
affiliates, parent companies harmless from any claims arising out of or=20
relating to your actions, including, but not limited to ...

I'd be interested in getting a lawyer's or expert's opinion on the=20
indemnification thing. The only one I've read so far that doesn't have it=
=20
is Wikipedia.
