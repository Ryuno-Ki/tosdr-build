I left out the indemnification part because it focuses on the users 
actions. 
>
>
Regarding the fees, I'll have to see. I do remember reading about an 
activation fee when I signed up, but there definitely was no mention of the 
sometimes-required deposit. I'll have a look around and see if they make 
the activation fees clear.

With the reduced ETF, Verizon had it when I signed up, but changed it 
shortly after. I'm planning on looking at the big 4 (Verizon, T-Mobile, 
AT&T [Sprint]) so I'll look for commonalities. 

The stolen phone policy is debatable. What if there's no option for 
replacement (i.e., no warranty) and the user is left without a phone. They 
shouldn't pay for any charges occured from the next billing cycle onwards 
and any premium charges (like apps or music) should be refunded after the 
stolen report. Ideally though, service would be shut off to the phone when 
the stolen report occurs.
