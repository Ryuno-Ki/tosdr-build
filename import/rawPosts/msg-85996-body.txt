I see a phone theft the same way I see a broken phone as far as 
replacements go. If you got phone insurance or have coverage of some kind 
then it gets replaced. If not, then it's on you. Stolen or broken isn't the 
phone company's fault, and you still need to be paying your monthly bill 
because your phone cost is subsidized in that. If you stop paying your bill 
then the phone company loses money on the subsidy. The main problem with 
stolen phones is the charges that get racked up on them (they call those 
phone numbers that charge you per minute). If your phone is stolen and you 
only have to pay the $300 to replace it then you got off pretty ok.
