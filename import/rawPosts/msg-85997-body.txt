This isn't as bad as it normally would be, because fundamentally github is =
about using git, a distributed content system designed to make it easy to c=
opy data about readily, with the only central points of control being those=
 agreed by convention, rather than being systemic.

So you always have *at least* one backup, and anyone else using the content=
 has a full backup, with full revision history.  To get back up and running=
 again you just need to choose another hosting service, or run your own.

It does warrant some care with domain names for the Pages feature, to keep =
domains under your control (much like you should use your own domain-name f=
or Blogger, so you can always move), and it would be slightly nicer if ther=
e were a way to have the github URLs reference your own domain-name.

But fundamentally, github closing your account and deleting your data is no=
t destructive, as it would be for a pure content hoster which is *not* desi=
gned to let everyone have a full copy of the data.  So while this term is u=
npleasant, when considered in context I don't think it's as bad as this rat=
ing suggests.
