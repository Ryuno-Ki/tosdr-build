As I'm looking through the data points we have on these sites I see a lot 
of topics that I feel like every site should have a statement about. As 
stated in the Get Involved page, the Ratings by Topic page gives a great 
starting point for this, but I think in the review process you should 
require every site get a data point for each of a minimum set of topics (if 
the ToS/PP doesn't mention one of these topics, then that should be stated 
in the data point). Examples:
Data privacy
Changing & accepting terms
Right to leave the service
Law and government requests

Obviously there will always be exceptions like DuckDuckGo that they may not 
apply to since they collect no information, but in general every site 
should have statements on these. If nobody else puts together a prospective 
list for this in the next couple days I'll put one together on Sunday.
