The Google/Steam route is a challenge when you try to use their service saying, "Hey! Our terms changed and you need to review them." I've also had companies email me when the terms changed, and even email me before terms changed to get public input o.o 

This Wordpress.com (http://Wordpress.com) TOS just seems very, "we're going to change the rules when we want, suck on it" to me.
