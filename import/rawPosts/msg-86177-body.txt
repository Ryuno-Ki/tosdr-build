Thanks for spotting this one. There is contradiction, we should check
with the people from AccountKiller to see what they mean and why they
state it's nearly impossible to delete your account.

I don't have in mind the details any more, but do they actually state
that they don't delete your data when you terminate your account? Maybe
that's what AccountKiller means.

Nahkaz or Pantsburgh or anyone else: would you like to contact them
about it? Otherwise I can do it.

Best,
