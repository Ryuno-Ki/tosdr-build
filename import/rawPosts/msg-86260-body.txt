*Flickr ToS & PP*


Overall this ToS seemed pretty good to me. Likely class B or C.


 *Flickr Privacy Policy* (This privacy policy is unique to the Flickr 
service)

http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/flickr/details.html


 *[1]* (good) User controlled privacy.


 *You can specify whether or not you want your photos to be accessible to 
the public, accessible to a select few, or private (only you can access 
them with your Yahoo! ID and password). *


 *[2]* (?) Flickr pro accounts cannot be canceled? This is in a section 
about email communication, and seems really out of place to me.


 *Communication with you *

   - 
   
   *Flickr communication is currently managed separately from your Yahoo! Marketing 
   Preferences <http://subscribe.yahoo.com/showaccount> and Subscriptions<http://subscribe.yahoo.com/showmailsubs>. 
   *
   - 
   
   *Visit your Flickr account information area to edit your email 
   notification settings <http://www.flickr.com/profile_email.gne>. *
   - 
   
   *Flickr Pro accounts cannot be canceled. *
   

 
 *Yahoo! Terms of Service* (Flickr users are bound by the Yahoo ToS)

http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/utos/utos-173.html


 *[3]* (bad) Terms of service may be updated at any time with no 
notification. Use of service is acceptance of ToS.


Section 1*
* 

*Yahoo! provides the Yahoo! Services (defined below) to you subject to the 
following Terms of Service ("TOS"), which may be updated by us from time to 
time without notice to you. You can review the most current version of the 
TOS at any time at: http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/utos/utos-173.html. 
By accessing and using the Yahoo! Services, you accept and agree to be 
bound by the terms and provision of the TOS. *


 *[4]* (bad) Real name required or grounds for account termination.


Section 3
 
*You also agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete 
information about yourself as prompted by the Yahoo! Service's registration 
form (the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the 
Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you 
provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or 
incomplete, or Yahoo! has reasonable grounds to suspect that such 
information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Yahoo! has 
the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all 
current or future use of the Yahoo! Services.*


 *[5]* (good) Yahoo is licensed to use non-text user generated content only 
in ways intended by the user.


Section 9
 
*Yahoo! does not claim ownership of Content you submit or make available 
for inclusion on the Yahoo! Services. However, with respect to Content you 
submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the 
Yahoo! Services, you grant Yahoo! the following worldwide, royalty-free and 
non-exclusive license(s), as applicable: *

*...*

*With respect to photos, graphics, audio or video you submit or make 
available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the Yahoo! Services 
other than Yahoo! Groups, the license to use, distribute, reproduce, 
modify, adapt, publicly perform and publicly display such Content on the 
Yahoo! Services solely for the purpose for which such Content was submitted 
or made available. *


 *[6]* (?) Users indemnify Yahoo. Seems like all ToSs have this; maybe we 
don't need to mention this?


Section 11*
* 

*You agree to indemnify and hold Yahoo! and its subsidiaries, affiliates, 
officers, agents, employees, partners and licensors harmless from any claim 
or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party 
due to or arising out of Content you submit, post, transmit, modify or 
otherwise make available through the Yahoo! Services, your use of the 
Yahoo! Services, your connection to the Yahoo! Services, your violation of 
the TOS, or your violation of any rights of another. *


 *[7]* (good) Right to leave service.


 Section 15

*You may terminate your Yahoo account, any associated email address and 
access to the Yahoo! Services by submitting such termination request to 
Yahoo!. *


 *[8]* (?) It sounds to me like Yahoo generally requires itself to have a 
reason to terminate your account, though this can be done without notice.


 Section 15

*You agree that Yahoo! may, without prior notice, immediately terminate, 
limit your access to or suspend your Yahoo! account, any associated email 
address, and access to the Yahoo! Services. Cause for such termination, 
limitation of access or suspension shall include, but not be limited to, 
(list of reasons).*


 *[9]* (bad) Statute of limitations reduced to 1 year.


 Section 27

*You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim 
or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Yahoo! Services 
or the TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of 
action arose or be forever barred. *


 *[10]* (bad) No mention of how law enforcement information requests are 
handled, or promises of transparency.
