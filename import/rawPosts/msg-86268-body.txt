I've made a couple potential lists of data points that I think should be 
required depending on the service. For instance, if a service requires a 
user registration and doesn't mention one of the associated data points 
then it would just receive a gray 0 score notification that the ToS doesn't 
mention anything about that. These are topics that I would want to know 
about for every site that I sign up for, and I'm just assuming that I'm a 
decent representative of the general populous.

*Services requiring registration:*
Changing Terms - *When and how can the terms change?*
Suspension and Censorship -* Can they end your use of the service at any 
time?*
Right to leave the service - *To avoid lock-in and stay in control*
Personal Data -* Can you control your privacy?*
Third Parties - *How is users' data shared with 3rd parties?*
Law and government requests - *How do services deal with government 
requests?*
Law enforcement and due process - *Are services transparent with their 
government requests?*

*Services with user generated content:*
Scope of the copyright license -* Do you grant only the necessary rights?*
Ownership - *What happens with the content you generate on the service?*

And if these get put on a guidelines page or something, it might be useful 
to mention
*Additional common topics to watch for:*
Anonymity and Tracking - *Are you being spied on?*
Waiving your right - *What kind of rights do you give up on?*
Governance -* Your relationship with the service and the community*
Cookies - *and related technologies*
Jurisdiction and Governing Laws -* undefined*
