Regarding suspension and termination of users' account: we would like to
compare GitHub and Steam. Hopefully this discussion could help us draw a
line between what's merely a practice not really fair for the user, and
what's really unacceptable.

Have a look at http://tos-dr.info/topics.html#suspension

We have
        50 Steam: Valve can cancel your account at any time.  =20
       =20
        Section 10:C =93Valve may cancel your Account or any particular
        Subscription(s) at any time. In the event that your Account or a
        particular Subscription is terminated or cancelled by Valve for
        a violation of this Agreement or improper or illegal activity,
        no refund, including of any Subscription fees, will be granted.=94
       =20
and, we have
        130 Github: Your account can be suspended and your data deleted
        any time  =20
       =20
        =93GitHub, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or
        terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future
        use of the Service, or any other GitHub service, for any reason
        at any time. Such termination of the Service will result in the
        deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your
        Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content in
        your Account. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to
        anyone for any reason at any time. =94
       =20
So far, I see two important differences:
      * Github's for *any reason* while Steam does not state so (does it
        elsewhere?). This leads us to ask a question: what does it mean
        for Steam? If they cancel your account for unvalid reason: what
        can the user do?
      * Github can delete your data, while Steam merely is about
        cancelling the account. It was pointed out that GitHub is based
        on Git which is distributed, so no important data would be lost.
        But I disagree with this, as GitHub is way larger than just a
        git repo hosting.
