Your second point first, Steam is not just about cancelling your account. 
Some people have tens or hundreds of games on Steam which can represent 
$1,000+ of transactions. To have an account terminated would mean losing 
all of that, so this could potentially be a really big deal to someone. 
With Github, the core reason you use the service is at least guaranteed to 
be backed up or recoverable, even if the extra features can't be.

As for the reasoning, it's still pretty hard to argue around "Valve may 
cancel your Account or any particular Subscription(s) at any time." even if 
it doesn't explicitly state "for any reason". That said, Steam does at 
least begin to provide reasoning when the no refund policy requires 
breaking the agreement terms or "improper or illegal activity", although 
that is still pretty vague. Github's is definitely stronger in this sense.

In my opinion, Steam should get the disbenefit of the doubt for being vague 
about it.
