Hi Pantsburgh, I think it's better if we break down each point to its
own thread, rather than to have one thread per service.

I often found it better to spawn discussions, etc. And also then it's
easier to compare different services on a similar clause.

I'll repost your Flickr analysis,

Thank you for your contributions!
(By the way, I credit you as Pantsburgh <palpants@gmail.com> inside the
JSON files. Let me know if you want me to credit your work in some other
way).

Best,
