So we have an ambivalent case. The copyright license can be both good
and bad here, depending on the type of content that's licensed.

http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/utos/utos-173.html
        Section 9 CONTENT SUBMITTED OR MADE AVAILABLE FOR INCLUSION ON
        THE YAHOO! SERVICES
        
        Yahoo! does not claim ownership of Content you submit or make
        available for inclusion on the Yahoo! Services. However, with
        respect to Content you submit or make available for inclusion on
        publicly accessible areas of the Yahoo! Services, you grant
        Yahoo! the following worldwide, royalty-free and non-exclusive
        license(s), as applicable:
        
Definition of "publicly accessible" follows.

This part is only about Yahoo! Groups. (We should create a thread
specific to yahoo groups maybe.)
        
            With respect to Content you submit or make available for
        inclusion on publicly accessible areas of Yahoo! Groups, the
        license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publicly
        perform and publicly display such Content on the Yahoo! Services
        solely for the purposes of providing and promoting the specific
        Yahoo! Group to which such Content was submitted or made
        available. This license exists only for as long as you elect to
        continue to include such Content on the Yahoo! Services and will
        terminate at the time you remove or Yahoo! removes such Content
        from the Yahoo! Services.
        
The copyright license is limited for the purpose of the service (and
doesn't include rights to transfer+sublicense) and terminates when the
user removes the content.

For photos and graphics (Flickr)  audio or video, it's pretty much the
same:

            With respect to photos, graphics, audio or video you submit
        or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of
        the Yahoo! Services other than Yahoo! Groups, the license to
        use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publicly perform and
        publicly display such Content on the Yahoo! Services solely for
        the purpose for which such Content was submitted or made
        available. This license exists only for as long as you elect to
        continue to include such Content on the Yahoo! Services and will
        terminate at the time you remove or Yahoo! removes such Content
        from the Yahoo! Services.
        
But for anything that's not photos, graphics, audio or video, it's not
really good:

            With respect to Content other than photos, graphics, audio
        or video you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly
        accessible areas of the Yahoo! Services other than Yahoo!
        Groups, __the perpetual, irrevocable and fully sublicensable
        license__ to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish,
        translate, publicly perform and publicly display such Content
        (in whole or in part) and to incorporate such Content into other
        works in any format or medium now known or later developed.
        
I don't really know what to make of that. Which services other than
Yahoo Groups deal with this kind of content? 

        "Publicly accessible" areas of the Yahoo! Services are those
        areas of the Yahoo! network of properties that are intended by
        Yahoo! to be available to the general public. By way of example,
        publicly accessible areas of the Yahoo! Services would include
        Yahoo! Message Boards and portions of Yahoo! Groups and Flickr
        that are open to both members and visitors. However, publicly
        accessible areas of the Yahoo! Services would not include
        portions of Yahoo! Groups that are limited to members, Yahoo!
        services intended for private communication such as Yahoo! Mail
        or Yahoo! Messenger, or areas off of the Yahoo! network of
        properties such as portions of World Wide Web sites that are
        accessible via hypertext or other links but are not hosted or
        served by Yahoo!.
