        11. INDEMNITY
        
        You agree to indemnify and hold Yahoo! and its subsidiaries,
        affiliates, officers, agents, employees, partners and licensors
        harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable
        attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out
        of Content you submit, post, transmit, modify or otherwise make
        available through the Yahoo! Services, your use of the Yahoo!
        Services, your connection to the Yahoo! Services, your violation
        of the TOS, or your violation of any rights of another.
        
I have to say I'm still sceptical about these. Even though it's pretty
common I still find them quite large. So I wonder: why doesn't Wikipedia
have such a clause for instance? Wikipedia also hosts a lot of content
in very various forms. I'm sure there are other examples where this kind
of clause is missing.
