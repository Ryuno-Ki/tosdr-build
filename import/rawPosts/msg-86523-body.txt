In general I thought they were pretty fair - you can read them here http://=
www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=3Dhp_13819201_cou?nodeId=
=3D508088

A few things that caught my eye -=20

Right off the bat - "If you visit or shop at Amazon.com, you accept these c=
onditions."  This is something that is weak from a legal standpoint.  Amazo=
n does not require you to acknowledge terms when you view or visit the site=
.  What would make this hold up is if there was a very visible notice or a =
acknowledgement indicating that you agreed.  It's like asking about a raffl=
e and then being required to enter it simply by asking about it.  It's almo=
st a nonsensical stipulation.  This is exactly why legitimate parking lots =
have "we will tow you" signs posted at the entrance of their lots.

As you read the rest of this - remember that you have already agreed to thi=
s by virtue of visiting Amazon's website.
      =20
"you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under you=
r account or password. Amazon does sell products for children, but it sells=
 them to adults, who can purchase with a credit card or other permitted pay=
ment method. If you are under 18, you may use Amazon.com only with involvem=
ent of a parent or guardian."  This is a somewhat contradictory clause.  If=
 your kid makes a purchase on Amazon (without your consent), he or she is e=
ntering into a contract with Amazon, which is immediately void because the =
contract is with a minor. Amazon is saying that you would be responsible, b=
ut that they cannot sell products to kids without their parents permission.=
  Clear as mud?

"We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted on=
ly on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representativ=
e action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitr=
ation we each waive any right to a jury trial."  That is, no one (not even =
a lawyer on your behalf) can bring a class action lawsuit against Amazon.  =
You must use an arbitrator - one selected by Amazon.   =20

I have a few more - including the use of any customer's name that may raise=
 some eyebrows. =20

However, overall nothing seems to be too out of line.  But I suppose that's=
 up to the reader.
