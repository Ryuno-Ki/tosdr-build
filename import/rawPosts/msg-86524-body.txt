I noticed a post to an article that has caught onto your project and I then
followed a link to the website of ToS;DR.

Of course, awesome idea, great and easy interface for the website, I was in
love...

But as someone on reddit has noticed, this awesome project would stay
awesome in the minds of many for 2 minutes and then would become a thing of
the past since it is bound to a website form.  Although I bookmarked it and
will check on it every so often for updates, I think that creating a plugin
for use on Google Chrome, Mozilla FF, and IE would be a great asset!

I would propose myself to help out with the effort for this to be achieved,
but I have very little knowledge of computer languages and can't really do
anything beyond print 'hi' while using Python. (Not even sure if I got that
one right...)


Good luck with your future endeavors! :)
