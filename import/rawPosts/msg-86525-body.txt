Changes to the agreement are automatically accepted after 30 days:
9. AMENDMENTS TO THIS AGREEMENT

You are renting what you buy, not puchasing the game, meaning Steam can at
any time cancell you're account and access to all your subscriptions.
If you accept the agreement, rent games and Valve changes the agreement
which you bought you game under, will failure to accept/comply with the new
agreement disable your Steam-account and access to what you've puchased.
