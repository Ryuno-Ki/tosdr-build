Fact is Chrome changed the way of installing extensions. It's not as easy 
as it used to be. You have to drag the file from your filemanager and drop 
it onto Chrome (that really is the only way). But you still can install 
extensions, which are not in the Chrome Web Store, and Chrome shows you a 
notification where you can get the information on how to install those 
extensions when you download one.
