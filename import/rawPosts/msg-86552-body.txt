"If you've bought the game, you may play around with it and modify it. We'd 
appreciate it if you didn't use this for griefing, though, and remember not 
to distribute the changed versions of our software. Basically, mods (or 
plugins, or tools) are cool (you can distribute those), hacked versions of 
the Minecraft client or server are not (you can't distribute those).

Any tools you write for the game from scratch belongs to you. Other than 
commercial use (unless specifically authorized by us in our brand and 
assets usage guidelines <http://www.minecraft.net/brand> - for instance you 
are allowed to put ads on your YouTube videos containing Minecraft 
footage), you're free to do whatever you want with screenshots and videos 
of the game, but don't just rip art resources and pass them around, that's 
no fun. Plugins for the game also belong to you and you can do whatever you 
want with them, as long as you don't sell them for money. We reserve the 
final say regarding what constitutes a tool/plugin and what doesn't."

Good:
- You can earn money from ads on videos you create.
- You can modify the game however you wish.
- You maintain the rights to any tool or plugin you create for the game.
