Brandon, exactly.

In the subscription agreement (which no one reads) they make it perfectly
clear that you are renting the game, not buying it: "Valve hereby grants,
and you accept, a limited, *terminable*, non-exclusive license and right to
use the Software for your personal use in accordance with this Agreement,
including the Subscription Terms. *The Software is licensed, not sold. Your
license confers no title or ownership in the Software.*" But on their
homepage and in their app they advertise with "*Buy* this game now", and
"use regular store prices" which all imply you are buying the rights to the
game in the same way as in the store.

I haven't heard any stores of people being thrown out from steam, but I
don't think that makes the agreement any more ok. We accept an awefull
agreement and hope Valve is a good guy company. They can any time terminate
your account for any reason.
One implication this has is that you have no right to modify the software.
That means modding (unless they've opened for it) and such isn't allowed.
There have been lawsuits where gaming companies have tried to sue people
modding games but the courts have concluded you buy the software the same
way you buy an IKEA table. Saw off a leg if you want. Modify that file if
you'd like. Under this agreement however, you don't own the game in the
same way as the IKEA table.
