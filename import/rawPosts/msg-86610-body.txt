But they can, and that's what makes it a bad agreement.
tos dr has to be about the agreement, now how the company chooses to use it.

An other thumb down is that the agreement allows the automatic installation
of software on your computer. This could be used to anything from ads to
malicious software.

Now, you can of course say that Vavle wouldn't dare to use any of their
rights stated ealier, but take a look at Good Guy Companies lik uTorrent,
(your favorite freeware) and Daemon Tools. They've all jumped on the
ability to get a little extra cash by selling their users.

We have to rate Steam's TOS from what rights it gives them and what rights
it takes from the user.
