Hello there, I was looking through your website (very useful, by the way),
and noticed that under Minecraft it said "No right to leave the service." I
didn't think this was right, so I took a look at the Terms of Service
here:  https://account.mojang.com/terms, and I didn't see anything about
not being able to remove your account. I may have missed it, but I don't
think it's true. It was quite easy to find the ToS though, and they had a
nice summary above the full thing.
