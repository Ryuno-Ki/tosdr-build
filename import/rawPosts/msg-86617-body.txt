Hi !=20

a first look at iCloud ToS (available=20
at http://www.apple.com/legal/icloud/en/terms.html)

Location based services :=20

- Data is transmitted to 3rd parties (Bad point)
- You must comply with these 3rd parties ToS when you use location-based=20
services (Bad point). Quote :=20

> When using third party services that use or provide location data as part=
=20

=20

- You can stop location-based services (Good point). Quote :=20

> You may withdraw this consent at any time by not using the location-based=
=20
> features and turning off the Find My iPhone, Find My Friends, or Location=
=20
> Services settings (as applicable) on your device and computer=20


ICloud backups :=20

- Apple does not provide any warranty for the integrity of your backups=20
(Bad point).=20
Quote :=20

> Apple shall use reasonable skill and due care in providing the Service,=
=20
> but, TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, APPLE DOES NOT=
=20
> GUARANTEE OR WARRANT THAT ANY CONTENT YOU MAY STORE OR ACCESS THROUGH THE=

Changing the service :=20
- if you have a paid account, and Apple downgrades the service, you get a=
=20
partial refund (Good point). Quote :=20

> If you have paid to use the Service and we terminate it or materially=20
> downgrade its functionality, we will provide you with a pro rata refund o=
f=20

Removal of content:=20
- Apple may watch your content and delete it without notice (Bad point).=20
Quote :=20

> You acknowledge that Apple is not responsible or liable in any way for an=
y=20
> Content provided by others and has no duty to pre-screen such Content.=20

I'm not sure for this one, as they have "no duty to pre-screen such=20
Content". But Content is described as both private & public documents. So,=
=20
does this give them the right to watch our private content ?=20

Our content licensing :=20

- Apple does not take ownership of user 's content (Good point)
Quote :=20

> Except for material we may license to you, Apple does not claim ownership=
=20
> of the materials and/or Content you submit or make available on the Servi=
ce.


- But we give to Apple a very permissive license : they can do anything=20
with our content as long as it respects the purpose you uploaded the=20
content for. If I understand them well, if you upload a picture in a=20
plublic space of iCloud, they can use it for ads for example. (Bad point)
Quote :=20
However, by submitting or posting such Content on areas of the Service that=
=20
are accessible by the public or other users with whom you consent to share=
=20
such Content, you grant Apple a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive=20
license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate,=
=20
publicly perform and publicly display such Content on the Service solely=20
for the purpose for which such Content was submitted or made available,=20
without any compensation or obligation to you.


Account termination :=20

- Users can terminate their account (good point). Quote :=20
You may terminate your Account and/or stop using the Service at any time.=
=20
If you wish to stop using iCloud on your device, you may remove your iCloud=
=20
account from the device by opening Settings on your device, tapping iCloud,=
=20
and tapping the Delete Account button. To terminate your Account contact=20
iCloud Support atwww.apple.com/support/icloud.=20

- Data is deleted after account termination (good point, just a shame that=
=20
data is not deleted ASAP). Quote :=20

> Upon termination of your Account you will lose all access to the Service=
=20
> and any portions thereof, including, but not limited to, your Account,=20
> Apple ID, email account, and Content. In addition, after a period of time=
,=20
> Apple will delete information and data stored in or as a part of your=20
> account(s).


Security :=20
- Apple does not take any responsibility in case of attack (Bad point).=20
Quote:

> APPLE DOES NOT REPRESENT OR GUARANTEE THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE FREE FROM=
=20
> LOSS, CORRUPTION, ATTACK, VIRUSES, INTERFERENCE, HACKING, OR OTHER SECURI=
TY=20
> INTRUSION, AND APPLE DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY RELATING THERETO.


defend and indemnify (bad point). Quote :=20

> You agree to defend, indemnify and hold Apple, its affiliates,=20
> subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners,=20
> contractors, and licensors harmless from any claim or demand, including=
=20
