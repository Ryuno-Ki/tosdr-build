Hi!

That's a great start! What critera did you have for selecting these=20
specific terms/data points?

We have made a detailed analysis of 22 TOS documents from a selection of=20
popular and not-so-popular websites. They contained some 450 *different *cl=
auses/terms,=20
summaries of which were added to a database. A hierarchical listing is=20
rendered if you visit http://www.commonterms.net/Commonterms.aspx  There,=
=20
you might find some more candidates for your list!

The counter in the rightmost column shows how many documents contained each=
=20
term. While the list gives a hint as to what terms are most common, it does=
=20
not - as your list does - tell what terms are the most important to a=20
typical user. Nor does it tell what terms are considered good and what=20
terms are bad. Both of these aspects, of course, are subjective.

We intend to soon publish this database with an open API so anybody can=20
read, add and comment.=20
Any comments on how that API should be designed most welcome!

Best regards
P=E4r Lanner=F6, CommonTerms
http://www.commonterms.net

PS. We would be very happy to include all TOS;DR terms, comments and=20
classifications in the database, so that CommonTerms previews become=20
semantically compatible with TOS;DR=20
