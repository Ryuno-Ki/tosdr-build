Hello...

I'm new to this, so be gentle. I couldn't find anything relating to www.las=
t.fm, so thought I'd make a start. Let me know if this is how to proceed, o=
r if there's a better format, and I can go through it more thoroughly.  Dis=
claimer: I'm qualified with a degree in Scots Law (LLB. Hons.), about to em=
bark on an LLM in Internet Law & Policy.

Stephen
