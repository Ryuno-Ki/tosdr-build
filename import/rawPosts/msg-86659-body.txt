-----------

First off, some personal feelings and random ranting about their Privacy=20
Policy.

In the first section. *1. How we collect and use personal information.*
*"When you sign up for a Spotify account or purchase Spotify=92s products a=
nd=20
services described on the Spotify Websites or access the Spotify Service,=
=20
we may ask you for and collect certain information such as email address,=
=20
postal address, age, gender residence and the URL of the website from which=
=20
you are signing up."*

Fairly straight forward and common stuff to do. Needed to verify that the=
=20
customer is who he/she is and for statistics/marketing purposes.=20
The second part how ever.

*"When creating a Spotify account, or connecting your already existing=20
Spotify account with your Facebook account, we will also receive and store=
=20
the following information from Facebook Ireland Limited (=93**Facebook**=94=
)=20
your name, user name, **password**, profile picture, unique Facebook=20
identifier and access token, gender, birthday and email address."*

If you register as a Spotify customer today, you will need to sign in with=
=20
your Facebook account. And when you do this they will receive your password=
=20
un-encrypted (To be able to handle authentication by them self) from=20
Facebook Ireland Limited (At least that is what I take home from this vague=
=20
description).

And continues with fairly unspecific on what data they gather while you=20
access their services and for what purpose.

*"In addition, when you use the Spotify Software Application, Spotify=20
Service and Spotify Websites, we will automatically receive information=20
about your use of the application, service and website including=20
information such as media that you access, queries you make, the URL of the=
=20
website from which you use or access the Spotify Service, date and time of=
=20
your request, your Internet protocol address, performance of your network=
=20
and computer, your browser type, language and identifying information, your=
=20
operating system and application version."*

The first part also mentions the use of the data gathered. Still this is=20
fairly straight forward. At least as far at Privacy Policies go :)

*"We will use your personal information (i) to provide the products and=20
services that you have purchased or requested (including Spotify Social, as=
=20
defined in the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use, and the display of=20
customized content and advertising), (ii) to communicate with you=20
concerning your account, customer service issues and other Spotify products=
=20
and services, (iii) to personalize and improve the Spotify Software=20
Application, the Spotify Service and the Spotify Websites, (iv) to ensure=
=20
the technical functioning of our products and services, (v) to develop new=
=20
products and services, (vi) to protect the copyright-protected content of=
=20
the Spotify Service (e.g. by limiting access to the Spotify Service content=
=20
to users with a Spotify account), and (vii) as otherwise stated in this=20
Spotify Privacy Policy."*

They are also kind enough to be a bit more specific on how they share your=
=20
Facebook information.=20

*"If you connect your Spotify account to Facebook, we will make available=
=20
and/or share your Facebook user name and your Facebook profile picture to=
=20
other Spotify users. Further, Spotify users may be able to use the Spotify=
=20
Service to search for or view your Spotify profile and the information=20
contained therein, such as Playlists, as defined below (for example, if=20
they know and input your user name in the Spotify Software Application or=
=20
Spotify Service)."*

And they do asks us to familiarize our selves with their privacy settings=
=20
within the Spotify client.
*"Please familiarize yourself with and use the settings in the preferences=
=20
pane as they provide you with some options to adjust the information in=20
your Spotify profile that may be viewed and your activities that may be=20
shared."*

And also they almost write the last part of section 1 as a warning.
*"If you choose to activate Spotify Social or otherwise publish your=20
playlists, starred music top lists, and current playing song (hereafter=20
jointly =93Playlists=94), your Playlist information will be publicly availa=
ble=20
to other Spotify users (for example, on your Spotify profile page or social=
=20
activity stream) and may be used, or re-shared by other Spotify users.=20
Spotify is not responsible for the use or re-sharing of Playlist=20
information by others once it is made public. If you do not wish for such=
=20
use or re-sharing of this type of data taking place going forward, you=20
should not activate Spotify Social and/or adjust your settings and=20
listening mode."*

*Section 2: Sharing information with others.*

*I quit work for today so i will follow this up tomorrow at work :)*
*Please comment any thoughts you have on the first section .*
