The age limit is common in the US.  The US (and I'm guessing England) has s=
trict requirements for obtaining, using and storing personal information fr=
om minors (under 13).  Many sites make a business decision to make their si=
te available only to people 13 and over in order to avoid the compliance re=
quirements. =20

In my opinion this is a neutral term. =20
