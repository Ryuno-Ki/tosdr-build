This is something I have been thinking about in the context of drafting ter=
ms and conditions for my own clients (Hi by the way - I'm a solo practition=
er based in London, UK).

The problem with a limited copyright licence is, what someone stops having =
any relationship with you and terminates the relationship, do you have to r=
emove all the content they have contributed? In the case of (say) comments =
on blog posts that could be annoying. In some cases a perpetual/irrevocable=
 licence may be the best way to make sure that what you have remains cohere=
nt.

Might this not depend on context? For a project like OSM or wikipedia, you =
absolutely need something that is irrevocable otherwise the whole thing bec=
omes unmanageable, on the other hand for facebook it might be reasonable fo=
r users to demand not only data portability but also the right to remove wh=
at they have contributed and thereafter prevent facebook from using it.

This is just my half-pennyworth. I haven't seen any general theoretical fra=
mework of rights you are using so I don't quite know how to judge.
