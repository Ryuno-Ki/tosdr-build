I got a reply from Valve just now on this issue. I'm going to post it here 
since we were discussing it off topic from the thread it was previously in.

They can in fact "disable" your account and delete your payment info and 
public profile. The way it is worded leaves room for them to retain you 
personal info on file for an undisclosed amount of time. "We keep 
information we collect as long as necessary to operate our service."

Concerning the "individual information" referenced in the privacy policy, 
it looks like the only data that would fall into this is aggregated data in 
the form of hardware surveys and sales/other stats sent to the game 
developers selling games on Steam. The privacy policy leaves room for them 
to do whatever they want in this area in the future, however.

=======Reply from Steam========

Thank you for contacting Steam Support.

We can permanently disable your account for you, remove any stored payment 
information and clear your Steam profile.

Disabling your account will not result in a refund, as explained in the 
Steam Subscriber Agreement.

http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/

The games in your account will not be accessible for future use. Once we 
have permanently disabled the account, we will not be able to reactivate 
the account upon a future request.

Information that we collect from users is used to operate our service, 
enhance features that we deliver as well as protect against illicit or 
damaging behavior.  We keep information we collect as long as necessary to 
operate our service.  The types of information we collect are described in 
the Privacy Policy.

We don't share personal information with third parties.  If you purchase 
something from Steam with a credit card your  credit card company processes 
the transaction, but of course they already have your information.
We share information with our Steam partners about how many copies of their 
games are sold, but no personal information is included.

If you have any further questions, please let us know - we will be happy to 
assist you.
