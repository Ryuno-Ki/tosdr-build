I'll start with saying: This post may be xbox heug. I'm sorry for
anyone's inbox overfilling.

I tag things as [good][bad][ugly][info] throughout. Ugly is the stuff
that bites you. Info may or may not be relevant, or may be commentary.

TL;DR: I'd give them a B. The "Minecraft" entry needs to be changed to
"Mojang" because the second part below also applies to Cobalt and
Scrolls, possibly 0x10c as well.

IANAL, so back up the salt truck.

Minecraft's TOS is pretty lean, and has some interesting subtleties,
but it has a big bit of legalese behind it thanks to Mojang

from http://www.minecraft.net/terms

> As we at Mojang strive towards releasing updates for our projects we cann=
ot guarantee that any project will ever be completed and/or provided suppor=
t for. There's always the risk of a project being discontinued at any time.

Read: Minecraft might go away. There's been a subtle, quiet promise
that the source will be released at some further time:

> Once sales start dying and a minimum time has passed, I will release the =
game source code as some kind of open source. I'm not very happy with the d=
raconian nature of (L)GPL, nor do I believe the other licenses have much me=
rit other than to boost the egos of the original authors, so I might just p=
ossibly release it all as public domain.
( http://www.minecraft.net/game )

Major points:

 * [good] Free to mod the game ( "you may play around with it and modify it=
" )
 * [good] Unlike some (read: StarCraft) the stuff you make is yours
("Any tools you write for the game from scratch belongs to you")
 * [bad] Can't monetize your mods ( "Plugins for the game also belong
to you and you can do whatever you want with them, as long as you
don't sell them for money.")
 * [ugly] Its not your call what your mod qualifies as ("We reserve
the final say regarding what constitutes a tool/plugin and what
doesn't.")
 * [ugly] TOS can change w/o retroactivity ("We reserve the right to
change this agreement at any time with or without notice, with
immediate and/or retroactive effect.")
 * [good] Promise of transparency ("We're trying to be open and
honest, and we hope people treat us the same way back.")
 * [info] Legal problems handled on case-by-case basis ("If there's
anything legal you're wondering about that isn't answered from this
page, don't do it and ask us about it.")
 * [info] Jurisdiction of Sweden.
 * [good] Removal of personal details ("You have the right, according
to the law Personuppgiftslagen (PUL) in Sweden to know about the
information registered about you. If it is wrong, insufficient or
irrelevant you have the right to make sure that it gets corrected or
removed.")


However...  This TOS is apparently overridden by the official Mojang
one, which is a much more complex, legalese document, found at
https://account.mojang.com/terms and which has a very nice TL;DR:

 * Our games are usually made available during development and will
contain errors and bugs.

 [info] Games may contain bugs.

 * Do not redistribute our games or any alterations of our game files.

[info] Don't pirate things.

 * You may develop tools, plug-ins and services for commercial use but
they may not seem official, such as using our logos. Do not make
commercial use of anything we've made without our permission.

[info] You're not allowed to use their branding unless they say otherwise

 * We are trying to be open, honest and trusting with the hope that
you hold us in the same regard.

[good] Open communication

here's what they have to say (with the standard "you're here so you
agree with this" boilerplate stuff taken out, look for [...])

INTRODUCTION

These terms and conditions incorporates the terms of use for the
mojang.com webite, our end user license agreement, our brand and asset
usage guidelines, and our privacy policy. By agreeing to these terms
and conditions you also agree to all parts of these four documents, so
please read through them carefully. If you are young and you are
having trouble understanding these terms and conditions, please ask a
responsible adult such as your parent or guardian. Remember to check
back here once in a while because we might change these terms and
conditions.

[info] they want people to understand their TOS.

If there=91s anything legal you=91re wondering about that isn=91t answered
from this page, don=91t do it. Basically, don=91t be ridiculous and we
won=91t.

[good] Open to legal questions.

MOJANG.COM WEBSITE TERMS OF USE

[...]

REGISTRATION, ACCOUNT AND PASSWORD

The details you give us as part of the registration must be correct.
You can change your registration details if they become out of date.
If you deliberately tell us something that you know isn=91t true, and we
end up in trouble or we lose money, we may hold you responsible. That
means that you may have to compensate us for the damage you cause and
what we have lost.

[bad] Its your responsibility to make sure things are okay and your
fault if it gets them in trouble.

You might need to register with us to access all of the parts of our
Website. The username and password that you create are private so you
must keep them to yourself. If you let someone find out your username
and password, and they do something bad with our website, we will hold
you responsible. You should change your password if you think someone
else knows what it is. If someone uses your password to do something
on our Website that you don=91t like or that causes you harm, we can=91t
be and aren=91t responsible.

[info] Your job to keep your account details private to others
[info] Your fault if someone breaks something in your name

RIGHTS OF USE AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

You are free to use our Website as long as you stick to these terms
and conditions. You can only use this Website and its content for your
personal use. You can=91t use our Website for commercial purposes, so
don=91t try and make any money from the Website. Your permission to use
this Website is personal to you, so you can=91t give it to anyone else.

Don=91t forget that we still own the Website and the content on it, but
we are giving you a permission to use it. We want you to enjoy using
our Website, but if we want, we can take away your permission to use
our Website at any time for any reason.

RESTRICTIONS AND OBLIGATIONS

You aren=91t allowed to hack, decompile or change our Website at all and
you mustn=91t do so. This includes the code or any content or data.
Basically, you should just leave it as it is. You also aren=91t allowed
to create any software or content that mimics our Website. We really
don=91t want any of our community to get confused about which is the
official Website and which is a website which someone other than us
operates.

[bad] Not allowed to handle Responsible Disclosure. [Sidenote: this is
hard to interpret, but the language "hack, decompile" generally means
"do something mean" but can be interpreted as "find holes at all"]

Please don=91t use our Website in a way which we might think is
offensive, immoral or illegal, or makes other people feel
uncomfortable. We don=91t want our Website to be used in a way which
upsets people.

You also aren=91t allowed to try to make money out of using our Website.

FORUM AND COMMUNICATIONS

If we are running a forum, we are just allowing members of our
community to put their thoughts on our Website. It doesn=91t mean we
agree with those thoughts, and we can=91t be held responsible for what
people post on our Website.

[info] They aren't responsible for what you say.

If we happen to see a post that we think is offensive, we might take
it down, but it=91s not our job to select or moderate all the posts
people make. What we say about forums and posts also applies to
anything which enables people to put any other content, views or
material on our Website or send it to others using the Website.

[bad] No requirement to moderate.

[...]

If you post any content on our Website, you must (and by doing so you
actually do) give us permission to use, copy, modify and adapt that
content as part of our business. This permission must be irrevocable.
You must also let us permit other people to use, copy, modify and
adapt your content. If you don=91t want to give us this permission, then
please do not post any content on our Website. Please think carefully
before you post any content, because it will be made public and might
even be used by other people in a way you don=91t like.

[bad] Content is public-domain

[...]

LIABILITY

When you use our Website, you use it =91as is=91. This means that we are
not making any promises to you about the standard or quality of our
Website, or that our Website will be uninterrupted or error free. We
only promise to provide our Website and any services with reasonable
skill and care. This means that we aren=91t responsible for any losses
you suffer as a result of your use of our Website.
If we have linked our Website to another website, it doesn=91t mean we
have checked that website. It just means that we think it=91s
interesting. We aren=91t responsible for websites linked to our Website.

[good] They'll do their best however they can.
[info] don't rely on this to be here forever.

PURCHASES

You can buy games from our Website, as well as other products. In
order to do this, our Website is integrated with third party service
providers. All of the things we sell on our Website are covered by
these terms of use as well as the terms and conditions of any of our
third party service providers. We try to make sure the Website only
shows games or products that are available, but of course we can=91t
guarantee that all of the games or products will always be available.

PRICE AND PAYMENT

You have to send us the money for the game or product when you make
the offer to buy it. We will keep this money for you. If we accept
your offer, we will take that money as payment for the game or
product. If we don=91t accept your offer, we will send the money back to
you.
The payment method and system is set out on our Website, but we might
change it every once in a while and we can refuse any form of payment
if we want. You must always pay in the currency set out on our
Website, but your credit card company should be able to exchange your
money if necessary. You credit card company might do security checks
to make sure it is really you making the order.

[Author's note: this is the most confusing block of text in the TOS,
but one of my Swedish friends informs me it is fairly common to escrow
purchases like this]

RETURNS, REFUNDS AND CANCELLATION

If you can=91t use a game or a product because it doesn=91t work, let us
know and we=91ll try to help you out.

[good] They help you if you need it in terms of their stuff.

The purchase of a game through our Website is a service that commences
when the download of the game starts, following which you shall not be
entitled to cancel your order for the game.

[bad] No refunds.

ERRORS

We do what we can to make sure all of the information on our Website
is correct. However, sometimes there might be errors. We might also
cancel or suspend a transaction if there has been an error.

[good] Promise to fix problems and revert changes if needed.

PROMOTIONS

Sometimes we run promotions. If we do, the main rules of the promotion
are below. There might be other rules relating to a particular
promotion, but we will tell you about them when we tell you about the
promotion.

The main rules are:

 * Only one promotion can be used at a time, and you can=91t use a
promotion with another offer.
 * Discounts are only valid until the date specified and they only
apply to purchases made on the Website.
 * Discounts are not refundable.

We might cancel any promotion at a time.

[good] Clear rules on refunds.


GENERAL STUFF

These terms of use are subject to any legal rights you might have.
Nothing in these terms and conditions will limit any of your rights
that may not be excluded under law nor shall it exclude or limit our
liability for death or personal injury resulting from our negligence
nor any fraudulent representation.

[info] This gets overruled by any local law.

We can change these terms of use at any time. We don=91t need to tell
you about the changes for them to have effect, and the effect could be
retrospective. You should check back here from time to time so you are
aware of any changes to these terms of use.

[info] TOS can change without notice.
[bad] don't have to tell you about changes
[ugly] Users job to find updates.

If you come to us with a suggestion for any one of our Websites or
games, that suggestion is made for free. This means we can use your
suggestion in any way we want and we don=91t have to pay you for it. If
you think you have a suggestion that we would be willing to pay you
for, you must tell us you expect to be paid before you tell us the
suggestion.

[info] Your suggestions can be their ideas.
[good] You can get paid for your suggetions.

GENERAL END USER LICENCE AGREEMENT

In order to protect the games that we sell through www.mojang.com
(each of which is referred to in these terms as our =93Game=94) and the
members of our community, we need these end user licence terms to set
out some rules for downloading and using our Game. We don=91t like rules
any more than you do, so we have tried to keep this as short as
possible. If you break these rules we may stop you from using our
Game. If we think it is necessary, we might even have to ask our
lawyers to get in touch.

[info] Be kind, rewind.

If you buy, download, use or play our Game, you are agreeing to stick
to the rules of these end user licence terms. If you don=91t want to or
can=91t agree to these rules, then you must not buy, download, use or
play our Game.

ONE MAJOR RULE

The one major rule is that you must not distribute anything we=91ve
made. By =93distribute anything we=91ve made=94 what we mean is =93give cop=
ies
of the game away, make commercial use of, try to make money from, or
let other people get access to our game and its parts in a way that is
unfair or unreasonable=94. So the one major rule is that (unless we
specifically agree it =96 such as in brand and asset usage guidelines)
you must not:

* give copies our Game to anyone else;
* make commercial use of anything we=91ve made;
* try to make money from anything we=91ve made; or
* let other people get access to anything we=91ve made in a way that is
unfair or unreasonable.
* =85and so that we are crystal clear, what we have made includes, but
is not limited to, the client or the server software for our Game. It
also includes modified versions of a Game, part of it or anything else
we=91ve made.

Otherwise we are quite relaxed about what you do - in fact we really
encourage you to do cool stuff - but just don=91t do those things that
we say you can=91t.

[good] Mod the games.
[bad] don't sell your mods.

[author's commentary: Does this include the translators for Minecraft
which handle mangling the protocol? There's several which have
commercial versions or cripple you if you don't buy]

USING OUR GAME

You have bought the game so you can use it, yourself, on your computer.

Below we also give you limited rights to do other things but we have
to draw a line somewhere or else people will go too far. If you wish
to make something pertaining to anything we=91ve made we=91re humbled, but
please make sure that it can=91t be interpreted as being official and
that it complies with this EULA and the brand and asset usage
guidelines and above all do not make commercial use of anything we=91ve
made.

[info] Don't make things look too official -- Its not theirs.

The permission we give you to use and play our Game can be revoked if
you break the terms of this EULA.

When you buy our Game, we give you permission to install the Game on
your own personal computer and use and play it on that computer as set
out in this EULA. This permission is personal to you, so you are not
allowed to distribute the Game (or any part of it) to anyone else.
This also means you cannot sell or rent the Game, or make it available
for access to other people and you cannot pass on or resell any
licence keys. You may however give gift codes that have been bought
through our official gift code system. This is important to help us
stop piracy and fraud and to protect our Game. It is also important to
prevent members of our community from buying pirated versions of our
Game or fraudulent licence keys =96 which we may cancel, such as in the
case of fraud.

You are also allowed to adapt our Game for your own personal
(non-commercial) use, but you must not distribute your adaptations in
any way that is unfair or adversely affects our rights in the Game.
Amongst other things, that means that you can=91t just rip-off our
assets or try to make money out of them. Beyond that, you are not
basically allowed to copy, reverse engineer or decompile our Game.

[info] Again, mod Mod and mod some more, just don't sell it.

Within reason you=91re free to do whatever you want with screenshots and
videos of the Game. By =93within reason=94 we mean that you can=91t make an=
y
commercial use of them or do things that are unfair or adversely
affect our rights. If you upload videos of the game to video sharing
and streaming sites you are however allowed to put ads on them. Also,
don=91t just rip art resources and pass them around, that=91s no fun.

[Author's commentary: Doesn't this apply to things like TechCrunch,
who use screencaps all day long? ]

Essentially the simple rule is do not make commercial use of anything
we=91ve made unless specifically agreed by us, either in our brand and
asset usage guidelines or under this EULA. Oh and if the law expressly
allows it, such as under a =93fair use=94 or fair dealing=94 doctrine then
that=91s ok too =96 but only to the extent that the law says so.

[Author's commentary: that clears it up. Confusing, but not entirely
unreasonable]

In order to ensure the integrity of the Game, we need all Game
downloads to come from a single central source: us. It=91s also
important for us that 3rd party tools/services don=91t seem =93too
official=94 as we can=91t guarantee their quality. Make sure that you read
through our brand and asset usage guidelines too.

[info] Don't say or act like your mod is endorsed by Mojang.

OWNERSHIP OF OUR GAME AND OTHER THINGS

Although we give you permission to play our Game, we are still the
owners of it. We are also the owners of our brands and any content
contained in the Game. Therefore, when you pay for our Game, you are
buying a permission to play / use our Game in accordance with this
EULA - you are not buying the Game itself. The only permissions you
have in connection with the Game are the permissions set out in this
EULA.

Any tools you write for the Game from scratch belong to you. Plugins
for the Game also belong to you and you can do whatever you want with
them, as long as you don=91t sell them for money / try to make money
from them. We have the final say on what constitutes a tool/plugin and
what doesn=91t.

[bad] They provide the game as a service. Its not yours.
[good] Mod it!
[info] Just don't do it for money

[Author's note: This is a constant, repeating thing in this TOS.]

CONTENT

[Author's note: This is almost identical to the previous note on content]

If you make any content available on or through our Game, you must
give us permission to use, copy, modify and adapt that content. This
permission must be irrevocable, and you must also let us permit other
people to use, copy, modify and adapt your content. If you don=91t want
to give us this permission, do not make content available on or
through our Game. Please think carefully before you make any content
available, because it will be made public and might even be used by
other people in a way you don=91t like.

[bad] What you make belongs to Mojang if you put it on their system.

If you are going to make something available on or through our Game,
it must not be offensive to people or illegal, it must be honest, and
it must be your own creation. The types of things you must not make
available using our Game include: posts that include racist or
homophobic language; posts that are bullying or trolling; posts that
might damage our or another person=91s reputation; posts that include
porn, advertising or someone else=91s creation or image; or posts that
impersonate a moderator or try to trick or exploit people.

[good] Play nice. No really, PLAY NICE.
[info] Or else.

Any content you make available on our Game must also be your creation.
You must not make any content available, using the Game, that
infringes the rights of anyone else. If you post content on our Game,
and we get challenged, threatened or sued by someone because the
content infringes that persons rights, we may hold you responsible and
that means you may have to pay us back for any damage we suffer as a
result. Therefore it is really important that you only make content
available that you have created and you don=91t do so with any content
created by anyone else.

[info] Don't rip other people's stuff. That's mean.

Please watch out if you are talking to people in our Game. It is hard
for either you or us to know for sure that what people say is true, or
even if people are really who they say they are. You should think
twice about giving out information about yourself.

UPGRADES

We might make upgrades and updates available from time to time, but we
don=91t have to. We are also not obliged to provide ongoing support or
maintenance of any Game. Of course, we hope to continue to release new
updates for our Game, we just can=91t guarantee that we will do so.

[good] We'll do our best to update things
[bad] We don't have to keep updating our things.

OUR LIABILITY

When you get a copy of our Game, we provide it =91as is=91. Updates and
upgrades are also provided =91as is=91. This means that we are not making
any promises to you about the standard or quality of our Game or that
our Game will be uninterrupted or error free or for any loss or damage
that they cause. We only promise to provide the Game and any services
with reasonable skill and care and even then you have to accept that
we may release games well before they are complete and so they may
(and often will) have bugs =96 but that=91s a price you pay for getting
them so early. The law in most countries says that we can=91t disclaim
liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence so if
your computer gets up and stabs you because of something we=91ve done
wrong then we=91ll take the hit on that.

[good] if its their fault, they'll take the fall.
[info] Bugs happen.

TERMINATION

If we want we can terminate this EULA if you breach the terms. You can
terminate it too, at any time, all you have to do is uninstall the
Game from your computer and the EULA will be terminated. If the EULA
is terminated, you will no longer be allowed to play our Game. The
paragraphs about "Ownership of Our Game=94, =93Our Liability=94 and =93Gene=
ral
Stuff=94 will continue to apply even after the EULA is terminated.

[ugly] you can disagree with the TOS, but it gets murky afterwards.

GENERAL STUFF

The EULA is subject to any legal rights you might have. Nothing in
these terms and conditions will limit any of your rights that may not
be excluded under law nor shall it exclude or limit our liability for
death or personal injury resulting from our negligence nor any
fraudulent representation.

We may also change this EULA from time to time but those changes will
only be effective to the extent that they can legally apply. For
example if you only use the Game in single player mode and don=91t use
the updates we make available then the old EULA applies but if you do
use the updates or use parts of the game that rely on our providing
ongoing online services then the new EULA will apply. In that case we
may not be able to / don=91t need to tell you about the changes for them
to have effect so you should check back here from time to time so you
are aware of any changes to the EULA. We=91re not going to be unfair
about this though - but sometimes the law changes or someone does
something that affects other users of the Game and we therefore need
to put a lid on it.

If you come to us with a suggestion for any one of our Games, that
suggestion is made for free. This means we can use your suggestion in
any way we want and we don=91t have to pay you for it. If you think you
have a suggestion that we would be willing to pay you for, you must
tell us you expect to be paid before you tell us the suggestion.

GUIDELINES FOR THE NAME, BRAND AND ASSETS OF ANY OF OUR GAMES

All of our games are really important to us and to our community,
which means that lots of you want to use the our Brands and the things
around our games to do cool stuff. We=91re happy about that. Sometimes,
however, people go too far and do things that make the community think
that their products and services are connected with or endorsed by us
or even produced by us. We are not happy about that. Especially when
people do it deliberately to take unfair advantage of the community
and our work in that way. When that happens, fans buy things thinking
they are official which they are not. That means we can't control
quality etc. which diminishes the value of the work we have done and
the trust that our community have in what we do.

We don=91t want you to stop doing the cool stuff that you do and so
these Guidelines are intended to help everyone understand what we
consider to be fair and unfair use of our =93Brands=94 and =93Assets=94. We=
've
had some help from some lawyers and they will also help us if we need
to take further steps to protect our rights but the purpose of these
=93Guidelines=94 is to give some clarity on what you can do without having
to contact us (or our lawyers) - and what you mustn=91t do or else we
(or our lawyers) will have to contact you. We hope you understand.

GUIDELINES

These Guidelines cover the use of our Brands and our Assets. For these
purposes, therefore when we refer to:
 * a Name what we mean is the name of any one of our games as well as
any names which are confusingly similar to the names of any of our
games;
 * our Brands what we mean is any Names and the related logos and
distinctive characteristics of any of our games;
 * our Assets what we mean is the code, software, graphics, textures,
sound and audio from any of our games and any videos or screenshots
taken from or our games.

These Guidelines apply in addition to and not in place of our Terms of
Use or EULAs. Please remember that we say in all of our EULA that we
have one major rule about our games and that is: Do not distribute
anything we've made =96 which means don=91t
 * give copies of our games to anyone else;
 * make commercial use of anything we've made;
 * try to make money from anything we've made; or
 * let other people get access to anything we=91ve made in a way that is
unfair or unreasonable;
 * unless we specifically agree to it or allow it under these Guidelines.

These Guidelines do not change that principle but are intended to help
people understand what we expect and want.
If something isn=91t covered by these Guidelines that probably means we
don=91t want you to do it. In any case if it isn=91t covered please don=91t
do it without getting permission from us. You can contact us at brands
at mojang.com. If something is specifically covered and permitted by
these Guidelines, our Terms of Use or EULAs applicable to any of our
games then you don=91t need to contact us.
Please also check back here from time to time because we will update
these guidelines and provide further guidance.

ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS

The first thing to say is that there are the following Essential
Requirements that apply to all use of the our Brands (which include
any Names) and our Assets. If you are allowed to use any part of any
Name, any of our Brands and / or any of our Assets then what you are
doing MUST:
 * NOT make people think that you or what your are doing is official;
approved or endorsed by us; or associated or connected with us;
 * NOT be unlawful, deceptive, obscene, harmful or disparaging;
 * NOT adversely affect any of our Brands or any of our Assets;
 * NOT include anything else around it that makes people think that
you or what your are doing is official; approved or endorsed by us; or
associated or connected with us;
comply with the relevant Terms of Use/EULA;
 * sufficiently differentiate the use of any Name you are using from
any other branding;

These are the "Essential Requirements".

[good] Use the brand within guidelines and they don't care.

WHAT YOU CAN DO

Non-Commercial Things

We are very relaxed about things you do for yourself. Pretty much
anything goes there - so go for it and have fun just don=91t distribute
anything we've made etc.

We are also quite relaxed about other non-commercial things so feel
free to create and share videos, screen shots, independently created
mods (that don't use any of our Assets), fan art, machinima etc;

However if you want to use any Name in the title of a product that you
distribute or service that you provide (even if it is for free) then
you have to:
follow the Essential Requirements;
 * do so in a way that honestly and fairly describes those things or
the purpose of them; and
 * ensure that the Name (which includes any confusingly similar name)
is not the first word and don=91t use any other aspect of any of our
Brands or Assets as part of any related branding, including as or as
part of any logo.

This applies especially if you want to set up and run blogs, servers,
community forums, fan sites, fan clubs, news groups, events and
gatherings.

[good] Non-commercial usage of brand is encouraged with rules.

Commercial Things

We are less relaxed about commercial things. You may not therefore use
any Names in or as the main name or title of commercial things.

You may use a Name as a secondary name or title if you:
 * do so because it is necessary to honestly and fairly describe those
things or the purpose of them:
 * follow the Essential Requirements;
 * ensure that the Name (which includes any confusingly similar name)
is not the dominant element or the distinctive part of the complete
name or title of what you are doing;
 * don=91t use any other aspect of any of our Brands or Assets as part
of any related branding, including as or as part of any logo.

To help you we=91ve suggested the following examples:

* "The Shaft =96 a Minecraft podcast" (we=91re cool with that).
* "Minecraft - the ultimate help app" (we=91re NOT cool with that)

You may not make any other commercial use of any of our Brands or
Assets for example you may not sell any merchandise that uses any of
our Brands or Assets and you definitely may not use our Names as
keywords or search tags for products that have no relationship with
them.
We love the idea of people doing cool things with our games and
sharing those things with the community. That's something we totally
support and encourage. So please feel free to do so but please also
make sure you don=91t go too far.

[info] Don't claim to be endorsed by Mojang.
[good] you can use the name/brand if you need to, e.g. in the title of
a podcast.

In addition to the Brand Guidelines above we also have the following
Asset Usage Guidelines that are intended to help you and everyone else
understand what we consider to be fair and unfair =96 what you can and
cannot do.

[good] Guidelines for brand usage.

Commerical Usage Guidelines

The One Major Rule still applies but we may make some exceptions and
they will be listed here, in this policy.
In this policy we will also give some additional specifics of what you
may not do. However if something is not mentioned here it involves
making money using anything from Minecraft (or anything else we've
made) please do not do it.
In addition to the specifics set out below, where we do allow you to
do something you will always need to add a credit as follows:

Minecraft =AE/TM & =A9 2009-2012 Mojang / Notch

[info] You have to mark stuff from Mojang if you use it commercially.

Videos and Screenshots

You may create, use and distribute videos of you playing or using our
Game for any lawful reason provided that you don't make any money from
them.

You may make money using your videos of our Game so as long as you
also add your own unique content to the video, such as audio
commentary. The amount you add must also be enough to make it fair and
worthwhile for someone to pay for it or for you to make money from it.
For example you couldn=91t just include your logo, web address or indent
but you could add an audio commentary or your own music if you are
creating a music video.

You may also make money using videos and screen-shots if it is covered
by so called =93fair dealing=94 or =93fair use=94 exceptions to copyright,
such as where it is for criticism and review, reporting current
affairs etc. In each case, you will still need to add appropriate
additional content and credits where applicable.

=85more will follow as and when we decide what to add - so feel free to
make requests =96 and If you are unsure about anything you may or may
not do, don't do it unless you get an OK from us first.

PRIVACY POLICY

It is important to us that your privacy and data are protected. Most
importantly we want you to know that we don't want to use your data
unless you are ok with it. That=91s why we have made this privacy policy
- so you can be clear on how we intend to use your data.

[good] Its your information, they want to make sure you're OK with that.

This privacy policy forms a part of the terms of use of any of our
websites (=93Terms of Use=94) and the end user licence agreement of our
games (=93EULAs=94). When you agree to our Terms of Use or EULAs you are
also agreeing to this privacy policy, so it is important that you read
it carefully. Agreeing with this privacy policy is a condition of the
Terms of Use and EULA. This means, therefore, that if you don't agree
with our privacy policy, you may not be able to play our games or use
features in them and you may not be able to use our websites or parts
of them. Sorry about that but we have taken this approach because
there are a lot of people playing our games and using our site and it
would be very difficult for us keep track of who does and who doesn't
agree to us using their data. We also depend on this data to enable us
to continue to develop our games and websites in an efficient way. We
hope you understand.

Please also check back here from time to time because we will update
this privacy policy every once in a while.

provide information about yourself when you use other parts of our
website or games or when you contact us. It is possible that you could
be identified personally from this information.

Please note that we never store information about your credit or debit
card ourselves. All such information is handled entirely by our third
party payment providers.

circumstances. For example, we might disclose your data in order
comply with a law or regulation, in order to protect our games, or if
we get taken over.

[good] Your information is released when needed, not when asked.

You have the right to know about the information which we hold about

INTERNET AWARENESS
