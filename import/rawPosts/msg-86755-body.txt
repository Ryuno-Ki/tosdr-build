I think it's valuable to work on other languages, but I'm worried that 
translation (using humans) will be costly. I'm also worried that some 
important details may not be translated properly. Automatic translation 
(e.g. translate.google.com and microsofttranslator.com) would introduce too 
many ambiguities due to inaccurate translations.

I bet many Spanish websites will have their ToS and privacy policies 
written in Spanish.
