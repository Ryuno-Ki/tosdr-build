As previously mentioned, Google's world-changing technology is one of the m=
ain reasons but Google's corporate culture is also very appealing to me. Go=
ogle's embrace of global, open-information, democratic ideals in it's corpo=
rate mission statement, coupled with the do no evil mantra makes it a very =
attractive employer.=20
