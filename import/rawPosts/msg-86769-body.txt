Currently we list World of Warcraft, (even though it should be named=20
Battle.net since this ToS covers Diablo and Starcraft), as the consumer not=
=20
having the right to leave the service. This is not true.

Here is the Current Terms of Service<http://No%20Right%20to%20leave%20the%2=
0service>
.

Here is an excerpt from this ToS.

*ACCOUNT SUSPENSION/CANCELATION.* BLIZZARD MAY SUSPEND, TERMINATE, MODIFY,=
=20
> OR DELETE ACCOUNTS AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON OR FOR NO REASON, WITH OR=
=20

> Game-specific Terms of Use, or a Game EULA will not be reactivated for an=

bout/privacy.html>
> .* Blizzard may stop offering and/or supporting the Service at any time.


This clearly contradicts what we currently have listed.=20

Also we should mention the fact that Blizzard can terminate your account at=
=20
any time.
