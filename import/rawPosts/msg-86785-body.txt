I think what tos-dr is doing is excellent and wish you every success.

I've accumulated a list of Internet connection services that prohibit
the downloading or making available for download of MP3 files. Not any
other formats, just MP3, which they seem to think is a kind of malware.
It isn't clear from your description whether multiple single-point
reports in one email are useful, but I hope this is useful. (Oh, and I
consider the blanket prohibition on a file format a bad thing.)

It's interesting that several of these terms pages have nearly identical
wording.
