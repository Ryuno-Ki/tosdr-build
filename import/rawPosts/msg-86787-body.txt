Hello everyone,

I am new to the list but I like the project very much and like to
contribute from time to time when I am reading ToS. I also read
through the "how to contribute" section of ToS;DR and give it my first
try now:

WhatsApp ToS at http://www.whatsapp.com/legal/#Privacy reads:
   "The contents of messages that have been delivered by the WhatsApp
Service are not copied, kept or archived by WhatsApp in the normal
course of business." [...]
   "If the recipient is not online, the undelivered message is held in
WhatsApp=92s server until it can be delivered. If the message is
undelivered for thirty (30) days, the undelivered message is deleted
from our servers. Once a message has been delivered, it no longer
resides on our servers. The contents of any delivered messages are not
kept or retained by WhatsApp =97 the only records of the content of any
delivered messages reside directly on the sender=92s and recipient=92s
mobile devices (and which may be deleted at the user=92s option)."

WhatsApp is a SMS-like messaging service and I think it is a good
point that they do not store any content of these messages.

What they do is Data Retention of date, time and mobile phone numbers:
   "Notwithstanding the above, WhatsApp may retain date and time stamp
information associated with successfully delivered messages and the
mobile phone numbers involved in the messages, as well as any other
information which WhatsApp is legally compelled to collect."

This is not a good point, but I think as this is also due to law in
many countries and a Directive by the European Union, you cannot blame
them to do so, no?

Erik
