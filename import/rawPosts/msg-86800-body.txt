I recently spent a few nights at Fountaingrove Inn in Santa Rosa, CA, USA 
<http://fountaingroveinn.com>. The tragically slow speed of the Wi-Fi gave 
me time to scan the ToS on the annoying "connect to the internet" redirect 
that I typically ignore when connecting to public Wi-Fi. I was particularly 
appalled by the "high volume usage" condition, and sections 1.6, 2.1, 
2.1.3, 2.5. 

I propose ratings for hotel (or public) Wi-Fi that include:
- Presence of DNS hijacking to force a connection screen, which makes me 
disable DNSCrypt and OpenDNS to connect
- JavaScript or HTML injection 
<http://justinsomnia.org/2012/04/hotel-wifi-javascript-injection/>
- Port blocks, such as SMTP
- Morality clauses that trump expression

Fountaingrove Inn's terms of service below, unmodified:
