Under "Access to and release of personally identifiable information":

As a general principle, the access to, and retention of, personally 
identifiable data in all projects should be minimal and should be used only 
internally to serve the well-being of the projects. Occasionally, however, 
the Foundation may receive a subpoena or other compulsory request from a 
law-enforcement agency or a court or equivalent government body that 
requests the disclosure of information about a registered user, and may be 
compelled by law to comply with the request. In the event of such a legally 
compulsory request, the Foundation will attempt to notify the affected user 
within three business days after the arrival of such subpoena by sending a 
notice by email to the email address (if any) that the affected user has 
listed in his or her user preferences.

Registered users are not required to provide an email address. However, 
when an affected registered user does not provide an email address, the 
Foundation will not be able to notify the affected user in private email 
messages when it receives requests from law enforcement to disclose 
personally identifiable information about the user.
