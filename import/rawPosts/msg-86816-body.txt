 There have been lawsuits where gaming companies have tried to sue people m=
odding games but the courts have concluded you buy the software the same wa=
y you buy an IKEA table. Saw off a leg if you want. Modify that file if you=
'd like. Under this agreement however, you don't own the game in the same w=
ay as the IKEA table.

Buy a boxed game. Read the EULA. The same thing is written in it : you do n=
ot own the software, you merely buy a license. There are complex legal reas=
ons behind it, related to the Intellectual Property. Buying software implie=
s transmission of IP ownership, which of course they won't allow. Same thin=
g goes for Free Open Source Software : you are given a license, the terms o=
f which are more (BSD) or less (GPL) permissive, but in no way do you own t=
he original software, which is still copyrighted, hence why these licenses =
tell you to reproduce the copyright notice.
