It's worth calling out a line just before the ones you quoted:

"You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours."

This limits Google's ability to legally use your content to "ways that do not violate your intellectual property rights".  Google could not choose to promote its services by using your data in a way that violated your copyright, for example.

This seems pertinent when considering the "not yet existing" service case because any new service Google started would also not be able to violate your IP rights over any content it used.
