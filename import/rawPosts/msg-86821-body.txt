That is true, but as long as the game does not need an online activation, t=
here is no possibility to prevent you from using or installing the game as =
you want, not to force you to accept a new ToS. This is different with stea=
m, and their ToS explicitly gives them the right to do so, and to force you=
 to accept all changes to the ToS.

My opinion is that forcing a user to accept changes of ToS is one of the wo=
rst possible points, since it opens the door for all other negative points =
in the future.

> Buy a boxed game. Read the EULA. The same thing is written in it : you do=
 not own the software, you merely buy a license. There are complex legal re=

 of which are more (BSD) or less (GPL) permissive, but in no way do you own=
 the original software, which is still copyrighted, hence why these license=
