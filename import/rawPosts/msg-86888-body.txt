Not unusual or particularly unreasonable. Without something like this a 
provider could potentially be sued in any place where a court decided it 
had jurisdiction over the provider. This way the provider knows what laws 
will apply and which court they will have to respond in.

Granted, this forces users to file suit in a place that might not be 
geographically convenient, but from an efficiency perspective this makes 
sense.
