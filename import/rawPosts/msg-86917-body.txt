G'day,

(My name is Mike Beltzner, and I work as Head of Product for Wattpad, anoth=
er Canadian technology company. I hope to be creating an easier to understa=
nd set of terms for our products, as well as to contribute in this forum to=
 help people understand the TOS that we have and why we have them.)

On this topic - Wattpad also has a moral rights clause, and it was a curiou=
s enough one that I asked a friend who's an IP lawyer and as it was explain=
ed to me, the reason many services require a waiving of moral rights is to =
protect the service from litigation in cases where:

* a work is presented (for example, in a list returned by a search) alongsi=
de images that the creator finds to be prejudicial to his or her honour or =
reputation,

* a work is presented with metadata overlaid or otherwise placed nearby tha=
t the creator finds to be prejudicial to his or her honour or reputation.

Basically, as service providers, we're saying that when someone submits a w=
ork to our services and agrees for it to be displayed on that service, they=
 can't then hold us responsible if in the normal course of displaying that =
work they find that they've been placed alongside or displayed in a manner =
they consider injurious.

I fully agree that we should not (and would not!) mutilate or distort the w=
ork in the course of displaying it, and would be happy to know if there are=
 other ways to protect ourselves without requiring a user to waive rights.

Regardless, I'm not sure that waiving one's moral rights constitutes an "al=
ert," as opposed to a "mediocre".
