Hi Jeremiah

What about creating another project focusing on hotel wifi ToS? Feel
free to take our code and our data (have a look at the licenses first),
change the name and the logo and go ahead ;)

The reason is that there are probably million of hotels, so we might
want to avoid rating ToS which are very too different.

Best,
