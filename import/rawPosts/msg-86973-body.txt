They can license your content out to somebody else, just like you did.
It will be on their terms, not yours. Rights to sublicense should be
limited.

That's rights to "use, display, etc.".

They can make an agreement with a photo agency and they will sell your
pictures for instance. There's nothing preventing them from doing so as
far as I see.=20

So, sure, it's not an exclusive license, so it means you still have your
rights. But, basically also have them, almost as if they created the
picture. It looks more like joint-ownership of copyright=85
