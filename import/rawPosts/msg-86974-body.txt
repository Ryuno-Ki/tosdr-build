That makes sense. But I don't think Flickr has this clause for example,
and it doesn't seem to be crowded and spammed by photographers' reps.

I didn't mean a competing photo sharing site, but a competing photo
business.

        "accounts may not be opened by galleries, agents and
        other       =20
        market intermediaries and entities who represent photographers
        and graphic artists or sell their works"

Imagine I'm a photographer. I want to make money and sell my work. I
want to expose to a gallery, but they also need you to sign  a contract
because they also need to make money. With such a clause, they wouldn't
be able to use 500px to make money. So you would have to use 500px
yourself -- but wait: that's usually not possible if you have a contract
with a gallery, as I imagine they might need exclusive licenses for the
time of the exhibition, etc.

So as a photographer, in some situations you cannot have both a gallery
or an agent, and a 500px account.=20

I have a hard time to understand exactly why. But I don't know the
website very much.

Maybe this should be treated merely as an informative point though,
rather than negative. After all, if the majority of 500px users think
it's better this way=85=20
