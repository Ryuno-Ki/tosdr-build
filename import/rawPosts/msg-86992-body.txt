I certainly do not, no, and suspect that we implemented these terms because
other services implemented them because some lawyer at some point was
trying to protect them from any litigation in the future. I agree that I
can't see it as being very likely, especially given ...

... the implication that the clause is unenforceable.

Do you agree, though, that the case we're trying to protect from
(displaying work A alongside work B, for example, in a way that the author
of one of the works considers to be injurious to their reputation) is not
something that's covered by one's "moral rights" as defined in the Berne
convention?

I'm willing to take the item out of our TOS, honestly, if it's meaningless.

cheers,
mike
