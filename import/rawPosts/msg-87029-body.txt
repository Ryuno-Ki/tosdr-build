Hi,

TOS for the site www.applits.com
http://applits.com/TOSforApplits.pdf

When Applits picks your idea and pays the $1500 you lose all rights to the =
idea for life, even if Applits doesn't make the app. If the app doesn't get=
 developed you can then buy back the idea (probably for the same amount) bu=
t then you have to pay out a lifetime 10% royalty to Applits in perpetuity =
and a free worldwide license to use the idea for non mobile use.

---------
Option to Acquire an Accepted Mobile Application Idea
If an Accepted Mobile Application Idea is not selected by Applits for devel=
opment, the Accepted Mobile Application=20
Idea Submitter will re-acquire ownership from Applits of all Intellectual P=
roperty Rights in the commercialized version=20
of the Accepted Mobile Application Idea, in return for paying Applits 10% o=
f all revenues generated from such=20
Intellectual Property Rights in perpetuity. If the Idea Submitter exercises=
 the aforementioned option, Applits shall=20
receive a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up, f=
ully transferable license from the acquirer of=20
the Intellectual Property Rights to use such Intellectual Property Rights i=
n Applits=92 business, but not to develop mobile=20
applications  that compete with the acquired commercialized version of the =
Accepted Mobile Application Idea. The=20
foregoing acquisition of Intellectual Property Rights shall be contingent u=
pon the acquirer signing Applits=92 standard=20
intellectual property assignment and license agreement memorializing the fo=
regoing terms. All net revenues, less=20
associated costs such as, without limitation, attorney fees, actually recei=
ved by Applits in connection with the=20
foregoing option shall be included with Mobile Application Sales Revenue wh=
en determining payments to Users=20
