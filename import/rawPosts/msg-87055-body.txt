I know this is a beta still, but having it would be good.

http://www.bitcasa.com/legal/

All of everything they have is at the link above.

Reading through it (with speak selection), the bad points I saw is that 
they will delete a file from every user (it's impossible to delete it from 
a single user) if a single user is sharing it illegally through their 
service.

I believe this is bad because if I were to own a copy of Microsoft Office 
and I placed the copy of Microsoft Office on there for backup and then some 
user also uploads their copy (DVDs being just duplexed rather than having a 
unique signature) and decides to share it on a big forum through their 
service illegally. They will delete that copy and anyone else who legally 
has a copy of it. This is just wrong as if I own it, I shouldn't be 
punished because someone else had the same file and shared it illegally.

Another point I read was they do not allow reverse engineering of their 
code. This isn't good for security reasons. If I cannot reverse engineer 
without my account being deleted, I cannot assess if it's secure or not and 
provided holes to the company at the email address they provided to send 
security problems found. Bad guys would go against the rules and look for 
holes by reverse engineering and use them against their customers. It is 
best not to have such a rule in their TOS just so people can do so that are 
white hat hackers and provide security problems to the company secretly.

Those are the only bad points I had, if you wish for me to provide good 
points, I'll have to re-read and listen for them:P

Hope this helps,
Mr. Gecko
