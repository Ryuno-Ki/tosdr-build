WhatsApp has no personalize advertisement, that means that they do not
sell users data to advertising companies:
ToS of WhatsApp @ http://www.whatsapp.com/legal/ reads:

"We do not use your mobile phone number or other Personally
Identifiable Information to send commercial or marketing messages
without your consent or except as part of a specific program or
feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out."

and

"We do not sell or share your Personally Identifiable Information
(such as mobile phone number) with other third-party companies for
their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as
part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the
ability to opt-in or opt-out."

to have an opt-out option should be normal but unfortunately, these
days you can see it as a good feature.

they do use unpersonalized information:
"We may share non-personally-identifiable information (such as
anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform
types, asset views, number of clicks, etc.) with interested
third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for
certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or
functionality on the WhatsApp Site."

but:
"We may use both your Personally Identifiable Information and certain
non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage
data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to
improve the quality and design of the WhatsApp Site and WhatsApp
Service and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and
services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and
trends. Hopefully we improve the WhatsApp Site and Service and don't
make it suck worse."

So they keep their doors open to change it in future. Finally, as it
is written now (the above quote) it reads good.
