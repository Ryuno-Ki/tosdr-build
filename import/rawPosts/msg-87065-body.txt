Hi,

What you said made sense, but as far as i can tell all sites that do some sort of photo sharing have these terms built into the conditions.

I found a good read here http://www.robertstech.com/copyright3.htm#pagetop

It makes very good sense of what this all means and confirms what you say, but reading all the points the guy made me comfortable with this whole sublicense use. 

Terms and conditions have always been lengthy and confusing to normal people, from credit cards, mortgages to using social networks online.

The irony i feel in this is that 500px when it started out just wanted to share pictures and all the legal minefield came along fast. I love that they have simple speak for their terms that normal people can relate too.

The recent quote from professor Niall Ferguson has stuck in my mind and i believe it 

"Has the rule of law degenerated into the rule of lawyers?"

Oh and thanks for creating this site and sorry if I pose too many questions for you guys because i can imagine how swamped you could be.

take care

John
