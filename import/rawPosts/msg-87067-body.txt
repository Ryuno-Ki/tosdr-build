I'm still unsure of the merit of rating 500px on this issue.

Professional photographers are allowed to use 500px and in a sense they are=
 promoting their work which could lead to sales. If i wanted to commission =
works or services from them i can click on their website link within 500px =
and go directly to their site and contact them.

But what I don't like and agree with 500px policy is having companies or ev=
en individual photographers  come into 500px and set up images selling thei=
r products or spamming my comments feed with products.=20

I have came across this on the site and have reported it and they have been=
 removed, the fact that its not wide spread might be because of the terms t=
hat 500px apply and they fact the community can report any violation to 500=
px in two clicks.

Oh this is a little off-topic but just want to give you some background as =
to why i suddenly appeared. As I have said i am a 500px member and your sit=
e came to my attention because another member read your site and was up in =
arms with the D rating for 500px and stated to 500px that if he had known h=
ow poor the terms and conditions of the site he would not have joined.

Now i agree with what you guys are aiming for but i have found that some pe=
ople in life don't take a calm, logical approach to things and can fly off =
the handle so to speak. While you make sense in what you write and that you=
 state that its only an opinion and you welcome open free discussion, i fee=
l that your grading system of A to E is rather subjective and limited in sc=
ale.

 In my opinion the member that was alarmed saw the D rating and seen red mi=
st and did not look at the whole picture. I base this assumption on the lim=
ited information he offered as he never mentioned anything specific but onl=
y the D rating which as we know from our school days is a big fail (i go ma=
ny of them)

Would it be better to go down the road of % rating and a more standard set =
of measurements and more sites before going live. For example measure 500px=
, flickr, smugmug, 72dpi, deviantArt on the same set of questions. Sort of =
like a checklist and column type thing  so as to give a more uniformed and =
measured comparison

anyways I commend you on what your trying to do.

regards
