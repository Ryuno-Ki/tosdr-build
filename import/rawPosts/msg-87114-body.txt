hi,

This message is mainly for Hugo, but you're invited to read along if
you're interested in our website operations:

i added a node script 'render.js' that generates the full index.html
into static html. hopefully it helps to fix some of the browser
problems and endless spinners that people have been having.

it takes index-prefix.html and index-suffix.html and puts the services
list and the popup elements in the middle. it writes its output to
index-gen.html and currently takes its services list from
index/services2.json

Hugo, please see if index-gen.html looks OK to you and then you can
copy it to index.html so that it's what people see when they visit the
site. do note that now each time after you run 'node buildIndexes.js'
you have to run 'node render.js' to make the new data visible in the
pre-generated page.

Also, if you want to make html changes to the index page, you'll have
to do them in index-prefix.html or index-suffix.html as appropriate.


HTH,
Michiel
