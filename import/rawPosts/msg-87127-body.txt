Hi John,

First, let me thank you for your continuous feedback on this. This is
exactly why we started the website.

I just changed the point to neutral and renamed "Open only to individual
photographers." I will have to look again at the score to see if that
affects 500px' class enough.

About users taking a simplistic approach towards what we do, there's
unfortunately nothing we can really do I suppose. It has been very clear
from the beginning that the project is young, and our data is still
subject to many changes (both in forms and substance). Now, I don't konw
about that other member. But maybe he wasn't happy with the copyright
license, or with the fact that changes can happen at any time.

On the percentage: it's kind of what we do "behind the scene". You
wrote:
        For example measure 500px, flickr, smugmug, 72dpi, deviantArt on
        the same set of questions. Sort of like a checklist and column
        type thing  so as to give a more uniformed and measured
        comparison
        
That's exactly the goal. See for instance http://tos-dr.info/topics.html
where you have the scores from 0 to 100. (Again, all of this is
premature: because we need a lot of data to make relevant comparisons.
But we have to start somewhere)

Best,
--
