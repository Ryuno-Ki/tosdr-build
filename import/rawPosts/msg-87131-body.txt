This is misleading. About sub-licensing:
        #3 and #4 are basically the same thing and are necessary because
        services like Filckr and Twitpic usually don't host the images
        shown on their sites. They are the host for the "operating
        system", if you will, of their services, but the grunt work of
        serving the images is usually farmed out to companies like
        Akamai.net and Quantserve.com who specialize in this kind of
        thing and have the disk space, server and bandwidth capacity to
        do so. They're called Content Delivery Networks (CDN's) and are
        standard operating procedure on the 'net these days.=20
       =20
This has nothing to do with hosting. I can host something for someone
(be an intermediary service provider), it doesn't mean I have a
copyright to grant others licenses on what I host. This is non-sense.
