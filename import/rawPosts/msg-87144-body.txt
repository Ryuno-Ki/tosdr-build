After EFF criticized the Black Rock LLC multiple times in the past on
their photo policy, they changed it in 2011 to be more reasonable,
while still keeping in mind the private and free nature of the event:
http://blog.burningman.com/2011/01/digital-rights/updated-terms-and-conditi=
ons-for-2011/

=BBYou are asked to identify whether you will use your images for
personal use or a public distribution, and to adhere to certain
guidelines thereof. These guidelines and agreements are aimed at
protecting Black Rock City=92s inhabitants and its cultural values; they
may seem unusual at first glance, but our goal is to preserve the
principle of decommodification within the Burning Man event, and to
encourage and observe respect for personal privacy and freedom of
expression. We primarily monitor dissemination of photographs to
ensure that photographs from Burning Man are not used for advertising
or commercial purposes, and that they do not infringe on participants=92
rights to privacy.=AB

Further, about joint copyright:
=BBI further assign to Burning Man a joint ownership in the copyright
for images obtained at the event so that in the event any third party
displays or disseminates any of my images in a manner not authorized
by this agreement, Burning Man can enforce against the third party any
restrictions concerning use of the images, and I appoint Burning Man
as my attorney-in-fact to execute any documents necessary to
effectuate such assignment. Burning Man agrees that it will not
utilize this joint ownership to enter into any licensing agreements
for the images.=AB
(Note last sentence.)
