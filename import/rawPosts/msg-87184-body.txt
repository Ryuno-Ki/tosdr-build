Hello, in the Skype Terms of Use 
http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/legal/terms/tou/#proprietary it said :

*" 11.2* Skype may terminate its relationship with you, or may terminate or 
suspend your use of the Software, User Account(s), Products or Skype 
Websites at any time and without recourse to the courts: 

(b) if Skype reasonably suspects that you are using the Software, the 
Products and/or Skype Websites to break the law or infringe third party 
rights; 

(c) if Skype reasonably suspects that you are trying to unfairly exploit or 
misuse the refund policy, or any of our policies."

It's a bad thing because that means that they can cancel your account if 
they really want without real justification ( just by using the abstract 
terms " reasonably suspects" ).
