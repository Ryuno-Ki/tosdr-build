I don't think this should be a thumbs down.

Their license basically just gives them the rights to use it on twitter.com=
 (or other 3rd parties).

"You retain your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on  or t=
hrough the Services. By submitting, posting or displaying Content on  or th=
rough the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive,  royalty-free =
license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy,  reproduce, process, a=
dapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and  distribute such Content in an=
y and all media or distribution methods  (now known or later developed)."

...


"All right, title, and interest in and to the Services (excluding Content p=
rovided by users) are and will remain the exclusive property of Twitter and=
 its licensors. "

They can't SELL your content for example. =20

I think that should be a neutral issues.  At least for twitter.

Maybe there are hostile companies out there that want to resell your inform=
ation though.
