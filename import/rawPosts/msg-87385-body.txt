Hi!

I recently came across your TOS;DR project, and i must say, bravo! People a=
lways love a new idea, and your's is just great!
I would like to suggest a very minute improvement. I am no law person, just=
 an ordinary layman. So I can't suggest something in that regard. But here'=
s my suggestion anyway.
While reading the simplified TOS for Facebook, I noticed a couple of spelli=
ng mistakes :(. In the third clause, you have mis-spelled solicit as "solli=
cit", and in the fifth one, you have written "Facebok" instead of "Facebook=
".
Now I know these are small mistakes, but I think coming from a law student =
(if I am not mistaken about your project lead's profession), it looks a bit=
 un-professional. It's nothing personal, I assure you. I love your project,=
 and will stay tuned for website ratings and more :)
Sincerely yours,Qasim ZaibAuthor: www.TechEclipse.com 		 	   		 =20
