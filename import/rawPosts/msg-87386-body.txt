yeah, but as you said, it's nice to fix them, and it's good that we
can fix them between all of us. in the future we should probably have
a 'fix spelling' button like on stackoverflow, to make it easier for
people to submit changes directly, and not have to wait for them to go
through the manual process of us editing the files and redeploying the
site. But for now, you can just send corrections like this by email,
like you just did. let us know if you find any more!

cheers,
Michiel
