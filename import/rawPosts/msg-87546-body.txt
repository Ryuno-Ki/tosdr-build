Yeah, this is not prohibited by the CAN-SPAM ACT, 15 U.S.C. =A7=A7 7701-13 =
in the United States, which only requires "opt-out" (or reply addresses) in=
 "commercial" e-mails. Service-related e-mails would likely fall into the "=
transactional or relationship message" category, which explicitly includes =
"warranty information, product recall information, or safety or security in=
formation" related to a service. 15 U.S.C. =A7 7702(17)(A).
