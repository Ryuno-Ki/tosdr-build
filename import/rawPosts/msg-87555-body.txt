F-List.net is a site for adult-themed RP. While, in itself, it is not a 
game, it hosts several, and provides services for freeform RP. The required 
reading before joining is in three documents, all available from the bottom 
of every page.
ToS: http://www.f-list.net/doc/tos.php
Privacy Policy: http://www.f-list.net/doc/privacy.php
Rules: http://wiki.f-list.net/index.php/Rules

*PLEASE BE WARNED: THIS SITE IS NSFW.* (but the ToS and Privacy Policy do 
not have any NSFW content on them)

I'm using the following to indicate my opinions on the terms:
I: information
G: Good!
~: Mediocre
X: Alert
?: I have no idea what to compare this to


*Services requiring registration:*

   - [~]Changing Terms: The terms can be changed at any time, with no 
   notice. "We expressly reserve the right to change these Terms of Use from 
   time to time without notice to you. You acknowledge and agree that it is 
   your responsibility to review this site and these Terms of Use from time to 
   time and to familiarize yourself with any modifications."
   - [~]Suspension and Censorship: Due to the adult nature of the site, 
   accounts can be banned if they belong to an underage individual. The usual 
   provisions barring harassment, impersonation, piracy, spamming, and hacking 
   the site also apply. Accounts can be banned without notice to the owner.
   - [~]Right to leave: While accounts can be 'deleted' (stated in the 
   ToS), this does not actually purge associated character profiles from the 
   database, but only renders them unviewable (not stated in the ToS, but 
   discussed in the suggestions forum). If you intend to leave, I would 
   suggest that you delete your characters first, and then the account. It's a 
   few steps, but it's definitely possible. It is also possible to open a 
   ticket and request the account and its associated characters be deleted. (I 
   have reasons to believe this discrepancy in policy vs reality is due to bad 
   code, rather than ill intent.)
   - [G]Personal Data: The only personal data required to make an account 
   is an email address, which is never made public. Other contact information 
   (IM names, usernames from popular MMOs) can be made available on character 
   profiles, and can be removed just as easily.
   - [I]Sharing RL Info: Aside from other digital methods of communication, 
   sharing personal information is prohibited. No personally identifiable 
   information may be shared, nor may RL meetups be arranged.
   - [~]Third Parties: "We will not share -any- of your data with third 
   parties without your permission." BUT "You also grant us the right to 
   disclose to third parties certain Registration Data about you." 
   Registration data consists entirely of a username, password, and email 
   address. No other information is collected, nor has any evidence, even 
   anecdotally, arisen of the second statement coming to pass.
   - [?] Law and government requests: In short, if it's public, it's 
   public. But, if it's not, you need a warrant. "We will not inspect or 
   disclose the contents of private Communications except with the consent of 
   the sender or the recipient, or in the narrowly-defined situations provided 
   under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, or as other required by 
   law or by court or governmental order."
   - [I]Age requirement: 18 years of age, or legal majority in your area, 
   if higher.
   - [G]API Access: "F-List does share some profile data (excluding contact 
   details) with other sites that may want to offer services like embeddable 
   profiles, and stuff like that. If you don't want this, turn API access off 
   in settings, and any access to your profiles is blocked."
   - [I]Shared Accounts: ...are prohibited. One account, one user.
   - [I]Multiple Accounts: ... are permitted, provided one is not using 
   them to evade a ban.


*Services with user generated content:*

   - [?]Scope of the copyright license: "Subject to our Privacy Policy, any 
   communication or material that you transmit to this site or to us, whether 
   by electronic mail, post, or other means, for any reason, will be treated 
   as non-confidential and non-proprietary. While you retain all rights in 
   such communications or material, you grant us and our agents and affiliates 
   a non-exclusive, paid-up, perpetual, and worldwide right to copy, 
   distribute, display, perform, publish, translate, adapt, modify, and 
   otherwise use such material for any purpose regardless of the form or 
   medium (now known or not currently known) in which it is used."
   - [?]Ownership: User retains all rights, but grants the site a 
   "non-exclusive, paid-up, perpetual, and worldwide right to copy, 
   distribute, display, perform, publish, translate, adapt, modify, and 
   otherwise use such material for any purpose regardless of the form or 
   medium (now known or not currently known) in which it is used."
   - [~]Copyrighted material removal requests: Upon receiving a properly 
   filed DMCA request, sent to the correct address, the offending material 
   will be removed, pending adjucation. (There is a list with eight bullet 
   points on the information that must be included in the request.) "You 
   acknowledge and agree that upon receipt of a notice of a claim of copyright 
   infringement, we may immediately remove the identified materials from our 
   site without liability to you or any other party and that the claims of the 
   complaining party and the party that originally posted the materials will 
   be referred to the United States Copyright Office for adjudication as 
   provided in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act."


*Additional common topics to watch for:*

   - [G]Anonymity and Tracking: No data is stored longer than one day. 
   "While we do collect data of site usage, both for statistical and for 
   security purposes (Pretty much all raw $_POST/$_GET data if you know what 
   this means) This info is deleted after one day. We don't store any data 
   like this for longer than a day. A cronjob is ran twice every day that 
   deletes data that is older than a day."
   - [I]Cookies: Site uses cookies for logins and to store user preferences 
   for the web-based chat client. Deleting the cookies logs out the user and 
   resets the client defaults.
   - [I]Jurisdiction and Governing Laws: State of Texas, US. "Each of us 
   agrees and hereby submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue 
   any court of competent jurisdiction within the State of Texas with respect 
   to such matters."
