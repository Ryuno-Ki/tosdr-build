This is a Cover Your Butt line. 90% of this is because of the target
audience being unable to pick their nose without causing drama; thus,
this clause tries to push drama out of the way.

I wouldn't consider it a "mediocre" thing, I'd consider it more an
informational: "Zero-tolerance for rule-breaking" (which is REALLY
hard)

This is a Good Thing. It might not be /straightforward/, but it is a Good Thing.

I know a few of their admins. The most their API gives out is what you
present to them. If you don't want it publicly available, don't put it
up.

This is a Good Thing. Under personal information protection, this is
pretty much the standard "come back with a warrant or GTFO" line that
I wish more people had.

This ties in with above (CYB)

Interesting, never saw that one in there for a long time. Looks like below.

If you've dealt with artists, there's drama involved when one notices
someone's using their picture that they were(n't) paid for and put
lots of effort into being used without permission.

Considering about 90% of webservers already do this (have you LOOKED
at what Apache can spit out on shared-hosting sites?)

The unfortunate thing is that they cannot actually control this. FWIW,
this is all it takes for PHP to register a cookie on your box:

<?php session_start(); ?>

Congratulations, your session cookie is set.

In ASP.Net, you don't even have to do anything. It just sets 5 of the
things. You're hosed if you put Google's analytics on your page too
(12 cookies). With Ruby On Rails, it may or may not set a few cookies
to keep tabs on things (because HTTP is stateless).

See why people are confused about Europe's cookie law?
