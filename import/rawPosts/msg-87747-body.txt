The bundle clause you're talking about affects games that are bundled 
together in a single purchase. If Steam cancels your subscription to one of 
these games (or if you request to have it canceled) they cancel your 
subscription to all items in that bundle. The best example of this is the 
bundles of Indie games that they often sell. 

If Steam were to cancel your account (or a user cancels their account) all 
games would inaccessible, so it doesn't really make that any worse. I'm not 
sure the bundle clause really builds on that enough to warrant mentioning 
in the "voluntarily cancel their account" data point on tos-dr.
