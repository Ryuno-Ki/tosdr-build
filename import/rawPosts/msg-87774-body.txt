I was recently caught out by this t&c on the interparcel.com site. I was no=
t informed when completing the online form to setup the delivery that they =
would not delivery to a PO box address, it was a internet based companies r=
eturns address. I tick the box to say that I had read the terms, but only s=
canned down them, of course now their have you because you ticked the magic=
 box. Anyway you end up paying for them to pickup and not deliver your pack=
age because it's a PO box address, bit of a scam. Their T&C's are about 10 =
pages long and this important information is about 7 pages down. Not very c=
ustomer friendly way of telling you, but they did not seems to care when I =
told them. I wonder how many people they catch out with this term.

8.7          Interparcel Ltd can only deliver to a full street address.  We=
 cannot deliver to a PO Box or BFPO address.  If a Consignment has to be re=
turned for this reason, no refund will be given.

Thanks
