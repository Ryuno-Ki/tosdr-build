Both. Sort of.

The no right to leave is based on a support page that says they can't
delete your account on request. Steam support confirms that users can
request to have their account cancelled (cut off access to steam and all
games), but there is no guarantee they will delete your personal info.

I've posted this in another thread dedicated to it, so it's mostly just
waiting to get enough comments to decide what to do with it.
