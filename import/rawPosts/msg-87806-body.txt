Ed, more legal expertise is always welcome!

A great way to get started would be to look through the services on 
tos-dr.info home page (especially those rated as "No class yet"). Click the 
"Exand" button below them and review the little blurb about each data 
point. Next to each data point on the popup modal there is a "discussion" 
button that goes to the thread which should have the copy/paste from the 
ToS for that item as well as discussion about it. Just throw in your 2 
cents on any items you feel inclined - especially items that may be in a 
legal gray area or that we might have rated incorrectly. You can get more 
info about the process of the rating system here > 
http://tos-dr.info/get-involved.html

You can also create threads if you find something in a ToS that we haven't 
covered yet.
