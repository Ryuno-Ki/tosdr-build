This is the exact same thing Steam said about cancelling accounts. You can 
remove any public personal info that random site visitors could see, but 
they keep the personal info tied to an account on file for an unspecified 
amount of time in the name of running the service.

I'm not sure if we should assume services are mostly trustworthy in this 
case, or consider them a liability to have them storing your info 
potentially forever. They do, after all, have to keep it on file for at 
least a little while in case they receive a lawsuit that a user needs to 
indemnify them for.
