I came up with this by cross referencing the current items on the ToS;DR=20
topics page ( http://tos-dr.info/topics.html ) with my own desires as a=20
user signing up for a service. Kind of subjective, I know, but this is what=
=20
discussion is for! :)

They said on IRC that the ToS;DR leaders are already in contact with the=20
commonterms team so I'll assume everything is already taken care of on that=
=20
front.
