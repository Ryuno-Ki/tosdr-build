It was originally written to say that FB owned all uploaded content. It was 
exposed, got a lot of media attention, and was rewritten to its current 
form. It's lame, I know, but it was enough of a backpedal that it stopped 
getting media attention which was all they cared about I'm sure.

Because musicians and movie production groups have legal teams that know 
how to read. :P  The best option for a photographer would be to only upload 
to FB the same or worse quality photo that is on your portfolio website (or 
would be on your portfolio website if you had one). Everything I upload to 
flickr is 800px wide for this exact reason (even though Flickr doesn't get 
an unlimited license to use your content). If Facebook or another user 
steals your photos it at least won't be high quality enough to create 
prints from it. At worst it gets used in a blog post without credit to you.
