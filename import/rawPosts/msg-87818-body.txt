Governing law (aka "choice of law"), jurisdiction and venue (sometimes know=
n as choice of forum) are three separate and distinct issues.

Having a stated governing law is always helpful - it sets the rules of the =
game that you're playing.  The specific choice of which law will govern, ho=
wever, is more complicated.  Certain states are seen as pro-seller and cert=
ain states are seen as pro-buyer (California is pro-seller).  Some are neit=
her (New York is a favorite because it's seen as relatively balanced)... an=
d some are irrelevant (nobody chooses North Dakota, for example, unless the=
y're based there).

Jurisdiction and Venue, on the other hand are even more complicated.  Juris=
diction is the question of whether the courts in a particular venue can eve=
n hear the case.  For that reason, you sometimes see the phrase that the pa=
rties hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of xyz courts in abc cou=
nty/state/country.

But if you ask most legal wonks (like myself) as to whether they intended t=
his to be a jurisdiction statement or a venue statement, they'll say it was=
 meant for venue and that jurisdiction is up to the courts themselves (and =
they're pretty well correct).  And, further complicating jurisdiction (and =
thus venue) is that the location of the parties is taken into account, as i=
s the nature of the issue brought to court.

Overall, I don't really care if a contract is silent on jurisdiction/venue =
because then I can argue about where the case should be tried.  Rather, I R=
EALLY care if a stated jurisdiction/venue is in a location that I don't wan=
t to have to appear in - such as the HUGE number of Terms of Service that s=
ay that the parties consent to the "exclusive jurisdiction of the county an=
d state courts in King County, Washington" because the person creating the =
ToS simply cribbed from Microsoft's license agreement (my favorite was the =
company based in New Zealand, but I digress).

So, short answer, my preferred statement is a jurisdiction/venue that I lik=
e (such as my home state), second preference is silence on the issue.
