On its face, this doesn't seem wholly unreasonable.

Consider this from the service-provider's perspective:

"We're going to create a service that essentially allows anyone, at any tim=
e, to upload content to our site.  We don't want to have to check for intel=
lectual property violations on every item posted because it takes WAYYYY to=
o much effort... and we can't spot check because then we open ourselves to =
contributory infringement liability through the Digital Millennium Copyrigh=
t Act (service providers are provide a "Safe Harbor" so long as they don't =
monitor content postings but take action when notified of potential infring=
ement).  So, how can we notify our clients that we aren't liable as a resul=
t of the acts of our members?"

The answer, I think, is the language you're seeing.  It's really a statemen=
t of truth.  The service provider is going to enjoy the Safe Harbor provisi=
ons of the DMCA ... and is going to hang the content provider out to dry (w=
hich, actually, is the way it should be).
