Sounds pretty bad to me. The user is responsible of checking the ToU for 
updates and continuing using the service is interpreted as an acceptance.

It is strange in the specific case of IFTTT since it has a passive usage of 
the service, because you can set up triggers that will continue to work 
even if you don't open the website.
