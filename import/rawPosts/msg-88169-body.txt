Hi Peter,

We are sorry about any confusion that may be generated by this clause in ou=
r Terms of Service. Thank you for posting your concern, and we'd like to cl=
arify a few points:

- It is true that Applits offers our $1500 cash prize in exchange for the r=
ights to your idea.  This is why we hold our competition; so we can underst=
and what the end-users themselves want to see in the marketplace, let them =
decide a winning idea, and purchase the intellectual property rights to the=
 idea so we can go ahead and create the app. We reserve the right to not ma=
ke your app if need be, because we cannot guarantee putting up hundreds of =
thousands of dollars in development costs if, say, a 3D game app idea wins.=
  After this point is where it seems some misunderstanding occurs...

- If the app doesn't win the competition, the intellectual property to the =
idea remains yours.  You can go develop it elsewhere, and you do not need t=
o buy it back. =20

- We are removing the clause you quoted regarding Applits receiving 10% roy=
alties for the life of the app if you decide to develop it elsewhere.  Init=
ially suggested by our attorneys due to Applits being the means for user in=
teraction and refining the idea during voting week, we've come to understan=
d our users' desires to not be roped in to such a commitment when submittin=
g their ideas that they may try to accomplish outside of Applits if not win=
ning the competition. (The new TOS will be applied during this month's comp=
etition, so if you submitted app ideas this month you will be exempt from t=
his clause).

I hope I've cleared up any misunderstanding that may have aroused from your=
 overview of the Applits Terms of Service; if you have any other questions,=
 please don't hesitate to contact us.

Thanks,

Keith
