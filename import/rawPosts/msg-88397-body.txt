I wrote a prototype of this a few years back.

It was a Mozilla extension that added an X-client-eula HTTP header to ALL 
requests which included the text of a EULA that the *USER* entered which 
basically says what the user typed into their dialog box.

This is based on the logic of "*If you visit or shop at Amazon.com, you 
accept these conditions.* " ...

which Amazon uses here:

http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_200905880_conditions?nodeId=508088

In my EULA I basically said:

"By responding to this HTTP request, you accept MY conditions and your 
conditions DO NOT apply."

Thoughts here?  

I realize it will SUCK for the websites that now have to READ all these ToS 
- but isn't this the situation they put US in to begin with?

I had an idea that if we were to standardize on a few basic ToS, the vendor 
could use the hashcode of the ToS to decide if they want to respond to the 
HTTP request.

Some websites and customers could BOTH have acceptable EULAs which allows 
them to work together.

Another idea could be to make them machine readable so that the client and 
server can both negotiate to realize that they are in agreement vs. the 
problem of having to read human text which for a machine will not be easy.
