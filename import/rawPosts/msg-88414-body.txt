I don't know if this is your bailiwick, exactly, but you do sound like peop=
le who might be interested. I think it's a serious issue, but I've had noth=
ing but shrugs when I mention it. Here is a description that explains thing=
s in kind of a backward way:

Caveat emptor

Hypothetical: You buy a 72" flatscreen Samsony TV at MegaMassive Electronic=
s. Two months later a major fault occurs and the TV's electronics fry. You =
go back to MegaMassive Electronics and they tell you that the 30-day return=
 period has expired, so you ask Samsony to have the TV fixed under the warr=
anty. They say, "Sorry, but we don't honor warranties for TVs sold by MegaM=
assive. They aren't a certified reseller of our products." You go back to M=
egaMassive and they say, "Yes, sorry, but after 30 days all warranty claims=
 have to go to the manufacturer. (On the plus side, you have a very nice 72=
" doorstop.)

Reality: That exact situation exists in real life, but the vendor is not Me=
gaMassive Electronics, it's Amazon.com. You have been warned.

Thank you.
