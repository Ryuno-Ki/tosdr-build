I'm not sure it's bad or neutral. It needs to claim property to be able to 
use feedback in order to use it to improve its service, otherwise it would 
be futile. It might be bad since feedback is a user generated content and 
the user might feel fair to keep the intellectual property or prefer to 
keep it confidential.
