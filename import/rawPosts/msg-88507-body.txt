i'd put this as neutral considering how controversial reddit can be.  If th=
ey're sued because of something you posted, you should foot the bill for it=
.  =20
They should have mutual indemnity though, with proper notice and tender to =
carrier.  But for UGC sites like reddit I'd always include an indemnity pro=
vision.  Whether they choose to enforce it is up to them.  =20
