I have not found the topic on this subject, so I made one of mine. 
First of all, I really like your initiative and I hope it will gain success 
in the future! And I hope that my comments will be useful too. 
One thing what we should not forget about Terms of Service is that actually 
there are questions, when you do not obligatory have to put information for 
customers on "Transparency on law enforcement requests". Why? Because the 
law enforcement requests are regulated by the legislation of the respected 
country, where you receive the services. And not only country - even 
region. For example, in European Union - there is one interesting legal 
act, which is the Data Retention Directive. Here will be a 
short description from Wikipedia(
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Retention_Directive) and here is a link 
to the legal act itself (
http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:105:0054:0063:EN:PDF
): 
The *Data Retention Directive*, more formally "Directive 2006/24/EC of the 
European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the retention of 
data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly 
available electronic communications services or of public communications 
networks and amending Directive 2002/58/EC" is a Directive<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_directive> issued 
by the European Union <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union> and 
relates to Telecommunications data retention<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_data_retention>. 
According to the directive, member states will have to store citizens' 
telecommunications data for six to 24 months stipulating a maximum time 
period. Under the directive the police and security agencies will be able 
to request access to details such as IP address and time of use of every 
email, phone call and text message sent or received. A permission to access 
the information will be granted only by a court.
So, what does it mean? The Directive has to be transposed to the national 
legislation of every country of the European Union, basically part or all 
of the provisions have to be included in the legal acts of 
the corresponding topic.
In this case, the mentioning of this Directive or it's provisions does not 
have to be done it ToS as it is by law. I am not " a devil's advocate", but 
it is a reality.
Unfortunately, I did not have time to google more on the subject of not 
European Union cases, so I don't have enough info about US or other 
countries. But this was just for example and maybe somebody could 
contribute it.
