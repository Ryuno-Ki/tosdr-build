<br>&gt;&gt; Hi,
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; I'm slightly good by AfterEffects and would like to make a sim=
ple short
<br>&gt;&gt; animated video describing the service of ToSdr its benefits.
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; These are some previous videos that I made:
<br>&gt;&gt; Steve Jobs Think different typography
<br>&gt;&gt; <a href=3D"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DJKTiHBZKZ-4" targe=
t=3D"_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?<wbr>v=3DJKTiHBZKZ-4</a>
<br>&gt;&gt; What's TEDx (in arabic)
<br>&gt;&gt; <a href=3D"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DJtA2pdbupV0" targe=
t=3D"_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?<wbr>v=3DJtA2pdbupV0</a>
<br>&gt;&gt; and a short typography from the Quran:
<br>&gt;&gt; <a href=3D"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dx4V8XDCKJH4" targe=
t=3D"_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?<wbr>v=3Dx4V8XDCKJH4</a>
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; anyway I'd like to make something like:
<br>&gt;&gt; DuckDuckGo's about video
<br>&gt;&gt; <a href=3D"http://duckduckgo.com/about.html" target=3D"_blank"=
>http://duckduckgo.com/about.<wbr>html</a>
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; or like this introductory video of
<br>&gt;&gt; <a href=3D"http://www.levelcloud.net/" target=3D"_blank">http:=
//www.levelcloud.net/</a>
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; It's the first time for me to make a product or service video =
but I'll try
<br>&gt;&gt; it :D
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; But, I need some help in writing the script for the video and =
any native
<br>&gt;&gt; or good English speaker to record it for me.
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; Thanks :),
