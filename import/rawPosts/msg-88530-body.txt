Hi group.

Being personally attentive to how private data is managed by online service=
s, whether or not these services actually erase private data matter far mor=
e to me than being allowed to leave. The European Commission has spoken in =
favour of the =ABright to be forgotten=BB ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/techn=
ology-16677370 ).

I don't care that much about whether I can unsubscribe (nowadays I don't su=
bscribe if I cannot leave), what I want is *all* of my private data to be r=
emoved from online services databases, according to the EU proposal. So you=
r work might be interesting in dissecting online  services terms and condit=
ions but the most important features to me are:
- does the site allow for unsubscribing? (one bad point for "no")
- are private data actually erased? (*ten* bad points if both are "no")

As a once member of LinkedIn I can witness despite their apparent "friendli=
ness" about unsubscribing, there's no direct clue private data will be perm=
anently deleted. On the contrary, there are irrefutable clues private email=
 addresses (and whatnot) remain in their databases after unsubscribing. You=
 can actually receive promotional messages from LinkedIn *after* you unsubs=
cribe, which proves they hold at least your email address for an unadvertis=
ed period of time.

Worse, if you ask them to not receive any of those promotional messages the=
y will just *add* your email address to another list of people who wish not=
 to receive anything! This makes *twice* as many chances to get your email =
address (who knows what more they keep?) being at risk, e.g. during a syste=
m break-in attempt, just like the one which was recently reported to have c=
ompromised about six million accounts!

So far to me, unless I'm proved the contrary (will be hard, I know that), t=
he only way to get your private data out of online services is to *not* sub=
scribe. *This* is where the *real* fight needs to take place to me actually=
.

Good day people,
Vince C.
