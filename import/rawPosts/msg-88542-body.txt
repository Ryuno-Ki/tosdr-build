<br>
<br>Being personally attentive to how private data is managed by online ser=
vices, whether or not these services actually erase private data matter far=
 more to me than being allowed to leave. The European Commission has spoken=
 in favour of the =ABright to be forgotten=BB ( <a href=3D"http://www.bbc.c=

<br>
<br>I don't care that much about whether I can unsubscribe (nowadays I don'=
t subscribe if I cannot leave), what I want is *all* of my private data to =
be removed from online services databases, according to the EU proposal. So=
 your work might be interesting in dissecting online &nbsp;services terms a=
nd conditions but the most important features to me are:
<br>- does the site allow for unsubscribing? (one bad point for "no")
<br>- are private data actually erased? (*ten* bad points if both are "no")
<br>
<br>As a once member of LinkedIn I can witness despite their apparent "frie=
ndliness" about unsubscribing, there's no direct clue private data will be =
permanently deleted. On the contrary, there are irrefutable clues private e=
mail addresses (and whatnot) remain in their databases after unsubscribing.=
 You can actually receive promotional messages from LinkedIn *after* you un=
subscribe, which proves they hold at least your email address for an unadve=
rtised period of time.
<br>
<br>Worse, if you ask them to not receive any of those promotional messages=
 they will just *add* your email address to another list of people who wish=
 not to receive anything! This makes *twice* as many chances to get your em=
ail address (who knows what more they keep?) being at risk, e.g. during a s=
ystem break-in attempt, just like the one which was recently reported to ha=
ve compromised about six million accounts!
<br>
<br>So far to me, unless I'm proved the contrary (will be hard, I know that=
), the only way to get your private data out of online services is to *not*=
 subscribe. *This* is where the *real* fight needs to take place to me actu=
ally.
