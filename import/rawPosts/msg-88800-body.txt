"This ere scroll belongs to a devious liar that be tellin' ye they're 
someone they're not." is all I see. This doesn't mean they are using 
pseudonyms, however it does mean they are lying about who they are.

They do ask for your real name at setup, but as long as you use a common 
last and first name, you can sign up. I tried signing up as "James Bond" 
the other day and they say to use my real name. I know someone who is named 
James Bond, so I'm surprised they don't allow it. I then changed the name 
to Robin Bond and it allowed me.

This means you can fake your name, however it is strongly discouraged and 
if you go and act like someone else, someone can report you.
