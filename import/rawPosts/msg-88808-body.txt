Hi Kevin,

Your proposal is interesting, and very much VRM related. Did you look at
EmanciTerm from ProjectVRM?
http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/projectvrm/EmanciTerm

However, the suggestion also reminds about the P3P standard, which wasn't
very successful.
Better look up experiences from that effort if we are to create a machine
readable/negotiable infrastructure.

IF user preferences are to be mechanically matched with provider terms,
some kind of standard vocabulary will be needed. For this, the CommonTerms
database of common terms (http://commonterms.net/patterns/) could be
useful. In it, every known term pattern is assigned a URI, such as
http://commonterms.net/patterns/how_does_the_user_accept/by_using_the_servi=
ce
The database is based on all terms found in a detailed study of 22 TOS
documents. Right now, the API is read-only, but it will soon be open for
additions by anybody. (Additions of new patterns as needed, but edits will
be moderated.)

Best regards
P=E4r Lanner=F6
