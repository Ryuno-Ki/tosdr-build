Your project reminds me of TOSamend 
http://owocki.com/2011/09/02/tosamend-the-easy-way-to-modify-web-service-terms-of-service-agreements/
A similar idea with weak legal standing unfortunately. As you mentioned, it 
will be too onerous for the website to negotiate terms with every single 
user, and a set of standards will be needed anyway.

I love the idea of robots negotiation agreements for us. Check out the 
CorpBot project
