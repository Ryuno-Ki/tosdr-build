I don't find 500px's explanation very compelling. Even accepting their 
argument, moral rights include also "paternity rights": the right of 
attribution. If I paint a portrait, I can't "sell" the attribution to you, 
so you can say you made it. Unfortunately in the US it's pretty standard to 
have a waiver of moral rights in work for hires and service agreements 
(also because US ratification of Berne's Convention was very limited 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention_Implementation_Act_of_1988). 

To be valid internationally, I think TOS should drop the moral rights 
waiver, but the current state is not so bad on the end users: any moral 
rights waiver is not enforceable in Europe anyway.

Mike: the case you're trying to protect falls under the integrity right, 
which is included in the Convention 
(http://www.law.cornell.edu/treaties/berne/6bis.html). A case might be 
interpreted in a different way: simply displaying 2 works together or 
changing the setting might not be a violation, but this is for the court to 
decide. It is true that the Bern Convention was drafted for a pre-internet 
world, and this part is probably outdated and too onerous for online images 
repositories.
