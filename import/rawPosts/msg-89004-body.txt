ideally, whenever a mailing list post contains a quote or refers to a
certain paragraph (which will often be the case when highlighting
something), then we should find that document and its line numbers in
the tosback2 repo.

it's important that we use tosback2 because that way we have a
canonical record of the historical version of the document; some
services change their ToS as often as once a month.

having said that, there are two problems with this:

- it's quite a bit of extra work; curating a thread into json takes
about 20 minutes once you're up to speed, but finding the reference on
tosback2 easily adds an additional 20 minutes to that. but we are
planning on maybe paying students to do this work, so then it would
become doable probably.
- it is not clear at this point to which extent tosback2 is a reliable
service. it wasn't running for several weeks on end last month. We
talked to EFF about this, and will probably set up a shadow instance
to reduce the risk of data loss in the future.

I will follow up on this - remind me if i don't! ;) so then you will
have a canonical reference to the exact document (URL), line number,
and (also important) the date on which the document was retrieved from
that URL.

does that answer your needs?

out of interest, what is the project you are working on? anything public ye=
t?

cheers,
Michiel
