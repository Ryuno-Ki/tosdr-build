Hi Matt,

I thought about that for a moment, but it was too difficult to maintain
etc.=20

So the way we do it is that in the data points we try to make the most
precise links to the source. Ideally, the source would point to the
excerpt from an archived version where people can also comment and
annotate.=20

I plan on doing that with co-ment.

Best,
