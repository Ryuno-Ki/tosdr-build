e-easy-and-friendly

Hi,

Thanks for taking the time to communicate on this.  Now allow me some
quick comments:
> First and foremost, the photographer will always hold the copyright of
> their work that was there prior to uploading. The photographer is in
> control of his or her photos and content.

Yes. But the whole point is that with the copyright license in the
terms, 500px also gets a very large control over the photographer's
pictures, a control that expands way beyond the technical requirements
for running the service.

> In our Terms of Service we use several fancy terms such as
> =93non-exclusive, transferable, worldwide license, reproduce, modify,
> adapt, publicly perform and publicly display, etc". In order to host,
> promote and crop your photos into thumbnails for various means like
> sharing on Facebook, Twitter and other social medias, we need
> permission from you to do so.

That's typically where there is quite a broad difference between what
the copyright license is and allows, compared to what 500px says it uses
it for.

As I explained on the thread related to this:
https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tosdr/X99SUnV7RUs/DL2qXYkRQUoJ the
limitation is "arguably weak".=20

It would be great if you could answer _precisely_ on that. I think the
copyright license in 500px terms could really be improved if it
reflected better how it is used by 500px and what users can do about it
(after all, it is *their* photos).

* * *

On Changes, as you can see on http://tos-dr.info/topics.html#changes a
lot of other services give more time for users to review changes. We
think this is important. If Google or Soundcloud can do it. Why not
500px?

* * *

About the 500px Store you state: "We will never remove any legal or
appropriate content from the 500px Store. "

Can you elaborate on this? How is it handled exactly? This may have been
in the terms something I overlooked. Because when I look at the terms
specific to the store, you wrote:
"In addition, 500px may remove any Store Images that it believes to be
in breach of the Terms"

I see a big difference between: "an image is inappropriate or illegal"
and "we believe an image breaches our terms". When I read a content is
illegal, to me that means either the infringement was really obvious, or
that a judge ruled that the content was illegal.=20

* * *

About the moral rights issue, I think the example is very far-fetched.
How's it going to apply to a case for 500px? I am very sceptical.

* * *

As for the indemnification clause, it is not only about copyright (and
500px would probably be under DMCA safe harbour or the EU ecommerce
exemption of liability for copyright infringement) and in connection
with the fact that you ask for a waiver of legal action, this all seem a
bit broad to me. Again, if you compare to other services, they do not
necessarily go to such an extent.


Thank you,
