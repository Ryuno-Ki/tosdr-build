Yes. But the whole point is that with the copyright license in the
terms, 500px also gets a very large control over the photographer's
pictures, a control that expands way beyond the technical requirements
for running the service.

> In our Terms of Service we use several fancy terms such as =93non-exclusi=
ve, transferable, worldwide license, reproduce, modify, adapt, publicly per=
form and publicly display, etc". In order to host, promote and crop your ph=
otos into thumbnails for various means like sharing on Facebook, Twitter an=
d other social medias, we need permission from you to do so. In our Terms o=
f Service we describe this by stating =93use your Content fully or partiall=
y for promotional reasons and to distribute and redistribute your Content t=
o other parties, web-sites, applications, and other entities, provided such=
 Content is attributed to you in accordance with the credits (i.e. username=
, profile picture, photo title, descriptions, tags, and other accompanying =
information) if any and as appropriate, all as submitted to 500px by you=94=
.

That's typically where there is quite a broad difference between what
the copyright license is and allows, compared to what 500px says it uses
it for.

As I explained on the thread related to this:
https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tosdr/X99SUnV7RUs/DL2qXYkRQUoJ the
limitation is "arguably weak".

It would be great if you could answer _precisely_ on that. I think the
copyright license in 500px terms could really be improved if it
reflected better how it is used by 500px and what users can do about it
(after all, it is *their* photos).=20
