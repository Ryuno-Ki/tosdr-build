Imagine that you post a take a photo. You put it to 500px in good faith.
But there is a building somewhere in the picture that has some kind of
protected architecture and you're not allowed to take pictures. Someone
sues 500px over this for infringement. That's a "claim" related to your
content.

500px, as the hosting provider of this picture, has some legal
obligations especially one of promptitude to react. If they fail to=20
respect their legal obligations, they can get sued over something
related to your content.

Even though you could have done it in good faith, you are now
responsible for 500px actions related to your content and you will have
to indemnify them if they ask you too.


Something that would be fair for the user is when users are responsible
for their content and their actions. It is normal that if users break
the law, the service seeks compensation from them for damages endured.
On the other hand, the service is already protected and not responsible
for the users' content if they are just a service provider (that's all
in the DMCA in the US, in the ecommerce directive in the EU, etc.)
