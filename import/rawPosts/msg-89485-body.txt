In my opinion part of this comes down to usability and intent. When I want 
to talk to someone privately I will send them an email or a text message or 
*gasp* call them. When I want to share things with my friends and family I 
go to Facebook. To me (and I think to most users) the private message 
system is really just minimum functionality - just like whatever the 
private tweets on Twitter are called, or the private message system on just 
about any internet forum software. With this in mind, it would actually not 
make sense to me if the buttons were the same size.

Additionally, I do think this falls a bit outside the scope of reviewing 
ToS and PPs. It's good to keep companies honest on what they say in the 
terms, but I don't think this violates any of that.
