Hi,

Can you elaborate how that's related to responsibility in case of 
unauthorised use of one's account? If you read the whole clause, you 
realise this isn't just about responsibility of content posted by the user, 
see:

> Youtube is not liable for any unauthorized use of your account, but you 
may be liable if this unauthorized use causes losses for Youtube or the 
others;

Note that "any unauthorized use" is larger than situations where the user 
is not acting carefully with the passwords.
