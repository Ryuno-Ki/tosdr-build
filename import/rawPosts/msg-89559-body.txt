Posting changes on the ToS page seems a fairly passive way to notify users.=
=20
I know for their recently combined policies they sent out an email to all=
=20
Google account holders informing them of the upcoming changes (back in=20
March). However, I've had an account for years and can't recall being=20
notified of any previous changes (which, to be fair, doesn't mean I wasn't=
=20
notified).

Still, although they suggest that users read the ToS page regularly, no one=
=20
(except this group, probably, haha!) does. I would give this a more neutral=
=20
rating rather than a full thumbs up. The 14 days to allow users to decide=
=20
(if they're aware) on the changes is good, though.

Thoughts?
