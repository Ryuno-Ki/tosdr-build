A good place to start is the classification page: 
http://tos-dr.info/#classification

Then look at the topics page:  http://tos-dr.info/topics.html 

That should give you a good framework for commenting on the data points you 
find. Also, you don't have to go through the whole thing, you can focus on 
one part of the terms and extract a point you find interesting or relevant.
