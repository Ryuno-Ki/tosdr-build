It is possible that you are right. What got me is that WhatsApp decides=20
what is appropriate which may lead to subjectivities... there is always=20
that thick line between inappropriate content and censorship.
I'm thinking, for example, in BlackBerry Messenger (a service similar to=20
WhatsApp) during London Riots[1].

<br>Hm. This isn't really "at any time, by any reason". And it's more about
<br>content removal and terminating a user's action to upload rather than
<br>fully terminating the account, etc.
<br>
<br>This seems quite reasonable to me.
