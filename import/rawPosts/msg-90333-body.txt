if it was optional, would you turn it on? that can of course be true.
like with music suggestions based on your playlists, very useful, i
always turn that on where it's available.

still, they should make it optional. people who find it relevant can
turn it on, people who find it annoying can turn it off.

that's not the point though, that's a separate consideration. if i
choose between a class A service that costs money and a class C
service that's free, then i might still choose the class C service, to
save money. But that doesn't suddenly make it a class A service. just
a cheap class C service.
