Yes. Pricing, usability, performance, features etc. should not
influence the ToS;DR rating. They are separate considerations when
choosing a service to use. The ToS;DR rating of a service can be one
more consideration, but it cannot overlap with the other
considerations a consumer takes into account when shopping around for
a service.
