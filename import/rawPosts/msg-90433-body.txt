Good catch! What is up with these law suit waivers, seriously? It seems so
contradictory to me to sign a legal document that says we will not be
following the law from now on...

Is the law suit waiver bidirectional? Will it also stop Microsoft from
suing its users? Let's ask Microsoft to comment on this, to get a fair
picture. Maybe they have a good reason to offer this service to their users
in this way.

At least they have given a fair bit of notice period, still seven weeks
left before it will become effective.


Ciao,
Michiel
