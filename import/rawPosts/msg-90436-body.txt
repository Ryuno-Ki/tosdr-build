I am not a lawyer (and English is not even my primary language) but=20
isn't that the point of the subpoenas? Is it OK for WhatsApp to decide=20
what a reasonable belief is? Reading the wikipedia article[1], the=20
examples are usually about police or other strong law enforcers (school=20
to students, governments to employees), but not between a company and a=20
person like this terms stands.
I would agree this is not bad if instead of WhatsApp's reasonable belief=20
it would be some generally accepted law enforcement institution belief=20
(police?).
