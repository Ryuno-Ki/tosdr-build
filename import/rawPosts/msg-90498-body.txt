so then would you agree that this is actually bad, not neutral? Also,
do the advertisers or any other third parties get to know about how
this personalized advertising works? If a loans company sees that its
ad is being shown to a certain IP address, then that may make the user
identifiable. And how long is this profiling information stored for?
if i'm broke today, will i still be tagged as bad credit 3 years from
now? and is it cross-matched with any other profiling databases in any
way?

if it's really just determining what i see on my screen during the
current session and nothing else, then i guess it's just a bit creepy
but can't really affect my opportunities. however, information about
people's financial situation is very sensitive and also very
sought-after by banker-type people who want to take advantage of you,
so it's pretty bad if my personal finance situation leaks in any way.
ultimately if my mint.com data leaks, then that could influence what
mortgage i can get later on in life. so be very careful who you give
that data to, and what you sign about how exactly they may use it and
how that can affect you.
