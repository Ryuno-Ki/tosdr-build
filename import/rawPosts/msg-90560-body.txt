Let's say someone is using the app or site and for some reason they come ac=
ross some information that some person using the site plans to commit some =
harm against a person.  It gives them the ability to release that informati=
on. =20

Again it's a reasonable belief. If there's a situation Where they release i=
nformation just to do it and are sued then it would be fairly easy to say t=
hey were unreasonable. =20

The benefits outweigh the harms. =20
