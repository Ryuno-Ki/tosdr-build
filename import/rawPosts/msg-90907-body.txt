Hey,

I just checked the ToS for Bitbucket since I'm using the site myself.

The info is found in paragraph 3.4 "End User Data". They describe "End User=
 Data" as anything the "End User" uploading to Bitbucket, including persona=
l information and code. You stay the sole owner of this data (they don't ta=
ke ownership for anything, which is good). But you give them the right to w=
ork with your "End User Data" (thus, your code, etc.) to operate the servic=
e.

>> End User hereby grants Atlassian a non-exclusive license to copy, distri=
bute, perform, display, store, modify, and otherwise use End User Data in c=
onnection with operating the Hosted Services.

They need this paragraph so they can present you and others with a website =
which contains your code and data (Commit overview, Wiki, etc.pp - that's w=
hy you use the site!).

They only use agregated information and data to improve the service, which =
is anonymous.

>> Atlassian may also use aggregate information to measure general Hosted S=
ervice usage patterns and characteristics of its user base and otherwise to=
 improve its products and services, and may include such aggregate informat=
ion about its audience in promotional materials or reports to third parties=
. This aggregate information will not reference names, phone numbers, email=
 addresses, or other personally identifiable information, and it will be no=
t traceable to a specific recipient or user email address.
