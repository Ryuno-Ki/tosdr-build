Hi!

If you like, the CommonTerms database of common terms can be used as a=20
master repository for such standardized patterns.

We already have a database of some 450 patterns, and can easily add TOS;DR=
=20
data points, and adapt the API to consequent requirements.
See http://www.commonterms.net/patterns=20
Every pattern gets assigned a unique URI, and when an HTTP call is made to=
=20
that address, a serialization of the pattern is returned.
When somebody (eg. after discussing the issue on the mailinglist) wants to=
=20
assign a data point to a website, they should start by searching the=20
database for a suitable pattern.=20
If they find one, they can assign the URI of the pattern to the website.=20
If they don't find one, they can add a new pattern to the database. This=20
will create a new URI, which they can assign to the website.
API methods for searching and adding to the database are under development.
URI structure needs to be discussed.

I can see that the idea of having a master repository of patterns conflicts=
=20
slightly with the Unhosted ideal of being independent of any single host.=
=20
But all patterns could be exported regularly as json files for offline=20
storage...

Best regards
P=E4r Lanner=F6, Commonterms.net

<br>
<br>this is something that came up in the opennotice confcall just now -
<br>if you look at for instance <a href=3D"http://tos-dr.info/topics.html#t=

<br>see the following data point texts:

<br>You must use your real name (yahoo)
<br>You must use your real name (facebook)
<br>You must use your real name (xing)
<br>You must provide your legal name (github)
<br>
<br>These (at least the first three) are obviously the same thing (even
<br>though we could weigh them differently depending on the type of
<br>service).
<br>
<br>Right now, we are not reflecting that, as data point texts are just
<br>free texts. But we could start doing that, and that way we would build
<br>up a valuable ontology of typical data points that we see recurring a
<br>lot.
<br>
<br>Once we have such a list, sites could pro-actively auto-review
<br>themselves, and in particular, if sites use templated ToS texts like
<br>the ones Docracy works on, then these could come pre-reviewed with
<br>such standardized data point texts. The weighing would then still
<br>depend on the specific service type, although even that could default
<br>to a common suggested value.
<br>
<br>Of course you could also then try to detect commonly used phrases in
<br>ToS texts, trying to treat human-readable texts as if they were
<br>machine-readable, but that's another extra step. For now just
<br>standardizing the data point texts would already be a very valuable
<br>thing, i think.
<br>
