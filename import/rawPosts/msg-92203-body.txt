Hi!

We can drop the CC-BY-ND license if there is a good reason to do that!

The only reason we put ND (no derivatives) in the license was because we
would not want anybody to confuse the meaning of a term/data point, by
publishing a modified version with identical name.
Anybody should be able to add new terms, but if they do, the new term
should have its own name and uri, or at least a new version number. That is
our only concern. Except for that, CommonTerms wants the material to be as
free and redistributable as it possibly can.

Please compare with Creative Commons licenses and icons! The CC icons are
NOT CC-licensed, and as far as I can tell, neither are the license
definitions (eg. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode).

Would you argue that Common terms definitions should have another license
than Creative Commons licence definitions?

Best regards
P=E4r
