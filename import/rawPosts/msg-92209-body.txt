Par,

The motivation behind the no derivatives license makes sense, but it
makes it hard for other services to build on your work. It's a classic
dichotomy of open source: if you want people to build on your work, you
have to let them fork it. FWIW, as useful as Creative Commons is,
nobody has been able to build on it (which may or may not be a good
thing depending on your point of view).

That said, you may be able to establish trademark over "Common Terms"
if you carefully protect it, which will give you much of the same
protection. People won't be able to say their terms are "Common Terms".
IANAL, but I think pursuing this route would allow other projects the
freedom to fork without diluting the meaning of "Common Terms" terms.

Or you could always just give ToS;DR a separate license.

Hi!
We can drop the CC-BY-ND license if there is a good reason to do that!
The only reason we put ND (no derivatives) in the license was because
we would not want anybody to confuse the meaning of a term/data point,
by publishing a modified version with identical name.
Anybody should be able to add new terms, but if they do, the new term
should have its own name and uri, or at least a new version number.
That is our only concern. Except for that, CommonTerms wants the
material to be as free and redistributable as it possibly can.
Please compare with Creative Commons licenses and icons! The CC icons
are NOT CC-licensed, and as far as I can tell, neither are the license
definitions (eg.
[1]http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode).
Would you argue that Common terms definitions should have another
license than Creative Commons licence definitions?

  We already have a database of some 450 patterns, and can easily add

  See [3]http://www.commonterms.net/patterns
  Every pattern gets assigned a unique URI, and when an HTTP call is

  When somebody (eg. after discussing the issue on the mailinglist)
  wants to assign a data point to a website, they should start by
  searching the database for a suitable pattern.
  If they find one, they can assign the URI of the pattern to the
  website.
  If they don't find one, they can add a new pattern to the database.
  This will create a new URI, which they can assign to the website.
  API methods for searching and adding to the database are under
  development.
  URI structure needs to be discussed.
  I can see that the idea of having a master repository of patterns
  conflicts slightly with the Unhosted ideal of being independent of
  any single host. But all patterns could be exported regularly as
  json files for offline storage...

  Hi,
  this is something that came up in the opennotice confcall just now -
  if you look at for instance [5]http://tos-dr.info/topics.html#track
  you
  see the following data point texts:
  You must use your real name (yahoo)
  You must use your real name (facebook)
  You must use your real name (xing)
  You must provide your legal name (github)
  These (at least the first three) are obviously the same thing (even
  though we could weigh them differently depending on the type of
  service).
  Right now, we are not reflecting that, as data point texts are just
  free texts. But we could start doing that, and that way we would
  build
  up a valuable ontology of typical data points that we see recurring
  a
  lot.
  Once we have such a list, sites could pro-actively auto-review
  themselves, and in particular, if sites use templated ToS texts like
  the ones Docracy works on, then these could come pre-reviewed with
  such standardized data point texts. The weighing would then still
  depend on the specific service type, although even that could
  default
  to a common suggested value.
  Of course you could also then try to detect commonly used phrases in
  ToS texts, trying to treat human-readable texts as if they were
  machine-readable, but that's another extra step. For now just
  standardizing the data point texts would already be a very valuable
  thing, i think.
  Thanks Veronica Par and others on the confcall for the suggestion!
  Ciao,
  Michiel
