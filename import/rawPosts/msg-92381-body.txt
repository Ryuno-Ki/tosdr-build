Thanks Joe for constructive proposals!

Will talk to legal advisor later today, but from my own perspective (I'm an
engineer) your proposal is  fine.

In fact, even if we already have 450 more or less common terms in the
database, much of the work remains to be done. Eg. adding legal
definitions, establishing a sustainable URI structure, curating the
database... We have legal people about to join the project for this
purpose, but cooperation with TOS;DR would be very inspiring and probably
help achieve critical mass and quality.
