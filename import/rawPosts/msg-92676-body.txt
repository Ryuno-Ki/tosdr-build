Thank you Sebasti=E1n Waisbrot and Steve Kroon for your posts about
Rapidshare, Nabble, Informe and Freeforums last Friday! I have
imported them with a provisionally assigned weight of 50 out of 100.
They now show up on our staging server
http://unhosted.github.com/ToS-DR/ and should go onto the live site
soon. We still need to compare which weights we have given to
equivalent point for other services to see what weight each point
should get, double check that everything is correct, and also add the
correct logos still.

Thanks a lot for your reviews, I'll try to free up some time so we can
be more responsive in transferring data points from the mailing list
to the website.

We are also launching our crowd funding campaign this week by the way,
so everybody who believes in this project, please have your wallets
ready! :)


Ciao,
Michiel
