so what should we conclude on this? you staying the owner of your data is 
of course good, but it's common practice, for instance iirc facebook and 
twitter both include that statement. as they don't ask for transferability, 
selling and sub-licensing, and explicitly mention the 'in connection with 
the service' i guess this is a relatively good one? we should put all the 
user data licenses next to each other and compare them to each other, so 
that we get a relative comparison between different alternative wordings.

i do think that if you upload data with the intention of having it 
displayed online, then requiring a public license is preferable over 
requiring a service-specific license. presumably if i'm ok with bitbucket 
displaying my, say, commit history publically, then i would also not have 
any problem with publishing it under a public license.

if i allow a service to display my data to other users of the same walled 
garden, but not outside it, then i think the service should only ask for 
permission to display it in the way i as a user configure, and they should 
hopefully not get a license to sell my (access to) data to third parties.

so in short i think to be able to get to a rating and weight for this 
thread, we need to have the more general discussion, comparing user data 
license clauses of various services relative to each other?
