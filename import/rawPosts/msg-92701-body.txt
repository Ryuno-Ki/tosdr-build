Very good idea to compare several of these user data licenses to get a grad=
ing. I back this up.

I think this a special case, because Bitbucket is also allowing you to have=
 so called private repositories which aren't available to the general publi=
c, but to other people ("users"), which you can give access to it for, or n=
obody but yourself. Most likely used by companies or for private projects w=
ithout an open source license.

 of course good, but it's common practice, for instance iirc facebook and t=

er data licenses next to each other and compare them to each other, so that=
 we get a relative comparison between different alternative wordings.
