It=92s getting a bit crowded in the unhosted web apps Github
organization, so I just got http://github.com/didnotread

I=92ll transfer ownership of all ToS;DR repos to that organization. I
already added Michiel, Hugo, Abdullah, Marco, Martin and me. Let me
know if I forgot anyone.
The move WILL break existing links to the /unhosted/ToS-DR repo, but
better sooner than later.

I also took the opportunity to rename the repos to more readable ones:
https://github.com/didnotread/didnotread.org
https://github.com/didnotread/didnotread-firefox
https://github.com/didnotread/didnotread-chrome
(Martin works on didnotread-safari :)

Just as a notice, you either need to edit your .git/config or reclone
from the new organization after the move is done. All merges and local
changes will still work.
