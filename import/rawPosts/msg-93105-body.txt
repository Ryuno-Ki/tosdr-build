I'm not really sure about this, some of minecraft's terms are unique to 
this service, also, most users are looking for minecraft's terms, not
Mojang's. Probably the best solution is to simply show people what 
they are agreeing to, if one term from Minecraft's agreement is overridden
by one of Mojang's, Mojang's should be placed instead. All for practical
reasons, it can be explained in the source.

I don't think it is bad that you can't monetize plugins, tools and mods, it 
helps
build a more open atmosphere, and it hasn't really hurt the game 
(there are thousands of mods/plugins/tools out there).

I think it's worth mentioning, but not as a bad point, but rather as an 
information point.

 * [ugly] Its not your call what your mod qualifies as ("We reserve

>
 

 * [ugly] TOS can change w/o retroactivity ("We reserve the right to 
> change this agreement at any time with or without notice, with 
> immediate and/or retroactive effect.") 
>

Given the relaxed nature of Mojang i don't consider this as an ugly
point, i'm pretty sure any decision relevant to this would be open for
discussion before anything ugly could come from it, again, i think this
should be an informative point
 

>  * [good] Promise of transparency ("We're trying to be open and 
> honest, and we hope people treat us the same way back.") 
>

I think this is more relative to derivative products, there is no explicit
promise to inform you of, say, government requests. Not sure
if it's worth mentioning
 

>  * [info] Legal problems handled on case-by-case basis ("If there's

>

Excellent

 [info] Games may contain bugs. 
>

Not sure it it's the right phrasing.


I think it is important to add that even the long Mojang agreement is
written in a simple, easy to understand lenguage.

[good] easy to read terms
