Good question! Forwarding it to the "Terms of Service; Didn't Read"
mailing list.

In this case, assuming you "ticked the box" that you have read and
agree with the current developer agreement, you have (maybe without
knowing it or without wanting to do so) agreed the following with
them:

"If you have any questions or concerns regarding a removal, you may
contact us at http://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-apps/.
Google reserves the right to suspend or bar any Product from the Web
Store at its sole discretion."

So you had a right to send that message to the chromium-apps list, but
they did not agree to reply to your question, and the removal is at
their sole discretion. I could not find any passage in the developer
agreement that stated anything like 'we will do our best to inform you
about our reasons' or 'we will only block your app if there is
something wrong with it' (they mention the points a-h which may
trigger a downtake, but nothing about informing you, and also directly
after giving this list of points, they state that it's at their sole
discretion anyway).

as far as i can tell, you have no right to appeal, or even to ever
find out why this decision was taken. Anybody else know anything about
that? The current developer agreement is here:

https://developers.google.com/chrome/web-store/terms

They may of course still reply to your question, it's only been a week
so far. Let's wait and see...

in the meantime i will see if i can find the corresponding passages
for alternative app publishing stores. like for instance the Mozilla
one (launching Q1 of 2013, i think), and there are a few others.

ciao!
Michiel
