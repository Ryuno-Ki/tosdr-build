found the *draft* Mozilla one, it's actually pretty similar in that
you have the right to send them an email, but they don't promise that
they will read it or respond to it. on the other hand, their takedown
clause seems to be, at first read, conditional. it seems to only ask
for the right to take down apps "if Mozilla is notified by you or
otherwise becomes aware and determines in its sole and reasonable
discretion that..." (and then a list of possible reasons).

https://marketplace.mozilla.org/developers/docs/policies/agreement

Mozilla Takedowns
Mozilla has the right (though not the obligation) to, in Mozilla=92s
sole discretion, remove any content that, in Mozilla=92s reasonable
opinion, violates any Mozilla policy or is in any way harmful or
objectionable.
Without limiting the foregoing, if Mozilla is notified by you or
otherwise becomes aware and determines in its sole and reasonable
discretion that any Marketplace Content or any portion thereof
(including without limitation any trademark, logo or other brand
feature associated with such Marketplace Content): (a) violates the
intellectual property rights or any other rights of anyone; (b)
violates applicable law or is subject to an injunction; (c) violates
Mozilla=92s Content Policy or other posted policy; (d) is being
distributed by you improperly; (e) may create liability for Mozilla or
anyone else; (f) is deemed by Mozilla to have a virus or be malware,
spyware or have an adverse impact on Mozilla=92s or anyone else=92s
networks or computers; or (g) violates these Terms, Mozilla may
prevent the Marketplace Content from being made available in the
Firefox Marketplace, remove the Marketplace Content from the Firefox
Marketplace,  flag, filter, modify related materials (including but
not limited to descriptions, screenshots, or metadata), reclassify the
Marketplace Content, or take other corrective action, at its sole
discretion. If you have any questions or concerns regarding a removal,
you may contact us at app-reviews@mozilla.org.
Mozilla may at any time suspend or terminate these Terms with you if
Mozilla is no longer going to provide the Firefox Marketplace or
Mozilla believes you have violated any policies or breached these
Terms.

Chrome web store also has the thing where it lists reasons, but after
that still has the generic "Google reserves the right to suspend or
bar any Product from the Web Store at its sole discretion.", which i
do not find back in the Mozilla ones.

also, Mozilla may terminate the contract, *if* ... etcetera. seems at
first glance to make a difference. i'll look  into it more.

Ciao,
MIchiel
