Thanks for your help Michael, it is really appreciated.

Sorry for the slow reply, just back from a couple of days away.

Thankfully someone from Google very kindly emailed me to help, so at least 
I can say I have a reply now :)

<br>
<br>In this case, assuming you "ticked the box" that you have read and

<br>
<br>So you had a right to send that message to the chromium-apps list, but
<br>they did not agree to reply to your question, and the removal is at
<br>their sole discretion. I could not find any passage in the developer
<br>agreement that stated anything like 'we will do our best to inform you
<br>about our reasons' or 'we will only block your app if there is
<br>something wrong with it' (they mention the points a-h which may
<br>trigger a downtake, but nothing about informing you, and also directly
<br>after giving this list of points, they state that it's at their sole
<br>discretion anyway).
<br>
<br>as far as i can tell, you have no right to appeal, or even to ever
<br>find out why this decision was taken. Anybody else know anything about
<br>that? The current developer agreement is here:
<br>
<br><a href=3D"https://developers.google.com/chrome/web-store/terms" target=
=3D"_blank">https://developers.google.com/<wbr>chrome/web-store/terms</a>
<br>
<br>They may of course still reply to your question, it's only been a week
<br>so far. Let's wait and see...
<br>
<br>in the meantime i will see if i can find the corresponding passages
<br>for alternative app publishing stores. like for instance the Mozilla
<br>one (launching Q1 of 2013, i think), and there are a few others.
<br>
<br>ciao!
