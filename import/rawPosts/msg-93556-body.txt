i'm not entirely sure about this one, i just checked for instance
gmail has the same clause, and i can't really imagine what it would
look like to not have this clause. would the company pay out damages
up to some amount? that sounds more like an SLA which is not really
reasonable to expect of a service, maybe?

how should we treat this?
