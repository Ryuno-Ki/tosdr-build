If everybody on this mailing list donates 10 euros today, we will have
4000 euros already during the first campaign day, and then the rest
will also follow probably. Even if you just donate 5 euros, it doesn't
matter. We need some visible engagement from all of you, to make a
convincing campaign start.

When people see that some donations were made on the first campaign
day, they will be more confident to follow suit. Let's do it!


Many thanks!!
Michiel.
