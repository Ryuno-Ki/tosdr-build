so what's our conclusion about this? also, what do we do with websites that=
=20
display a like button? i would say if we observe that a certain website=20
displays like buttons, we should warn users that they are being tracked by=
=20
facebook. this probably affects about half the web, but still i think it=20
would be the accurate way to deal with this.

maybe also make this affect facebook as a service, because like buttons=20
become more harmful if you are logged into facebook and/or have a facebook=
=20
cookie on your system.

i don't know, maybe we want to just display a light point (weight 10 or so)=
=20
for sites that are displaying like buttons? is that fair?

<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;=20
<br>"anonymized information"???? WTH. They have "browser-related

<br>really anonymity? what's browser-related information? is a cookie
<br>browser-related?
<br>
<br>Fortunately the last part gives us some guarantee; but I'd be more
<br>confident if they were in the terms rather than an help page=85
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; we do not use the information we receive wh=

<br>Now. That's an interesting question: they say they "delete or anonymize=
"
<br>which supposes that the information is previously not anonymous -- I
<br>suppose that refers to information recorded on users logged-in.
<br>
<br>So as I understand, that means that for information gathered on users
<br>who are logged-in, Facebook keeps the information &nbsp;forever (except=
 the
<br>user-id). That information includes "the web page you're visiting, the
<br>date and time, and other browser-related information".
<br>
<br>TODO: facebook states they don't sell or share it unless they have "you=
