Hi all,

Just a quick update to let you know we reached the 25% mark of our
Indiegogo campaign already! \o/ Thanks a lot, both to everybody who
chipped in, and everybody who tweeted about it! To help us keep up
this great pace, please give this link to your friends and followers:

You can really help us by showing others that you are following this
project, and if they see that you endorse the crowdfunding campaign,
more people will hopefully be convinced to also help out and donate.


Many thanks!!
Hugo, Jan & Michiel
