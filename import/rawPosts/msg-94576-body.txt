Hey, does anyone ever update the main site? Because I'm pretty sure a lot=
=20
of paperwork got lost in the newsgroup.

I just thought of a new regulation as part of OCILLA (the law that created=
=20
the notice and takedown procedure) where service providers take=20
responsibility for copyrights assigned to them. So if you make users=20
transfer copyright to you, you cannot qualify for safe harbor protection.
