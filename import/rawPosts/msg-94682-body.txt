yeah, i like the concept of creative commons for public content. for
instance, identi.ca terms of service have the following three clauses
about who gets to publish your content and how:
* By submitting Content to Operator for inclusion on your Website, you
grant Operator a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license
to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content solely for the
purpose of displaying, distributing and promoting your notice stream.
* By submitting Content to Operator for inclusion on your Website, you
grant all readers the right to use, re-use, modify and/or
re-distribute the Content under the terms of the Creative Commons
Attribution 3.0.
* If you delete Content, Operator will use reasonable efforts to
remove it from the Website, but you acknowledge that caching or
references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable.

I wonder why they need the first one if they have the second on, it
seems to be included in CC-BY? But it seems they added the second one
themselves when deriving their ToS from the Wordpress ones, so maybe
they left it in there "just in case".

So yeah i agree with Mike that if i publish something to the world,
using some a hosted service as a tool for that, then i would prefer to
publish my material under CC-BY than go into a specific agreement with
the tool i happen to be using. For limited-audience publishing and for
storing private data, this is of course not possible, there you have
to trust the specific service that's guarding your data for you.
