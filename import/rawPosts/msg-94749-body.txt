my beef with the osm board is that originally it was cc-by-sa, and now
they changed it breaking compatibiltiy with all known licenses. now
you cannot use other data that is share alike but have to explicitly
get everyone to assign all rights to the osm foundation for all time
and they can change the license at will.

there is no way for external parties to now make data available to osm
except via public domain and there is no license or external
independant license review board.

that is why i ask tosdr to give them minus points because they have
made the TOS very much more difficult to understand, creating all
types of problems. Also there is no longer the creative commons team
to review the license, there is no porting process to other places and
no translation process like in cc. all of these things are in my eyes
a step backwards.

now this is not even considering the new odbl license, which is only
temporary, there is no security of future compatibility, only the whim
of the osmf board who has no responsibility to contributors and can
and has also refuse membership to people they dont like for no reason
and with no responsibility to contributors, only paying members.

So these should all be negative points against OSM. Wikipedia has been
much better and has also a new TOS which seem to be respecting
contributors and peoples rights.
