That is largely dependent upon a very specific kind of contract law, and
even if you call them differently, it does not change anything. In
Germany and in France, we call the GNU GPL a contract, even if it's a
license. The only difference that you may have between contract and
license is that in the contract it's an agreement where both parties are
doing something (we call that "contrat synallagmatique" in French) and
license an agreement where only one party is doing something and the
other parties are just enjoying the benefits.

Now, with the GPL, it's a license with conditions. You have to respect
the conditions. So the distinction between license and contract is
really subtle, and frankly only matters to legal discussions which are
not really at core with our discussion here.

As I wrote to you on twitter, copyleft has always been contractual, even
if with "license" it doesn't say its name. Copyleft is not in the law,
you have to write a legal text (a contract or license, whatever you call
it, or terms) where you are creating your own set of conditions,
supplementing conditions set forth by law.

To put it simply, if you don't have the contract with copyleft, then you
juste have the plain application of legal copyright (which isn't
copyleft, because in copyright the author keeps the exclusive right to
make copies, make changes to the work etc.)

But you have to respect a set of conditions (copyleft conditions and
other conditions)! Of course copyleft gives you greater freedom than
copyright, that's the whole point.

It really depends on what the contributor terms say! in the case of Open
Street Map, they can only license them under free and open source
licenses (ODBL and CC BY or CC BY SA -- I don't remember) or future
licenses agreed by 2/3 of the active contributors.

Copyright assignment or fiduciary agreements sometimes are necessary
with copyright because you may need better way to manage the copyrights.
For instance, look at Linux. There is no copyright assignment, no
"contributor terms". The downside is that Linux is stuck with GPLv2
forever! It's okay because GPLv2 and Linux are pretty straightfoward to
deal with. But for Open street map it's way more complicated: database
rights, etc.

So again, you need to analyse what the Contributor terms say and so far,
I don't understand your concerns over these terms as they only make
possible the use of free/open licenses.

[of course, the way OSMF dealt with the whole change is also a subject,
but I don't know a lot about it]

Best,
Hugo
