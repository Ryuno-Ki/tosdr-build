This is clear and I dont have a problem with that, it concerns the
output and reuse of the data.
now lets say that I have reused this data and conform to the license,
I publish my changes to the database on my website. But I have not
agreed to the CT and the people cannot import it back it.

So to be clear, the question is how to have a third party contribute
indirectly. So a gov agency or company or even a person wants to
publish new data that can then be imported or used by a contributor.
not to just use the database but to add new data. For me that is the
biggest issue that we have lost the ability to use cc-by-sa data
sources, such as wikipedia, and also free hosting for sources such as
archive.org.


So, say I was to make a new derived database from osm, make changes
and publish them, that data could not be used in osm because it would
only be available under the current license regime, but not under all
future ones. So it cannot be imported.

so there is my eyes no way to really interact with osm except to be a
direct contributor and give your rights to the osmf, because they can
change the license at any time, there is no contractual security, no
compatibility with the future licenses promised. They can change the
license at any time and then all third party data would have to be
removed.

I am hoping that I am wrong on this point, but it is my current view
of the subject.
thanks,
mike
