Right. It's a fork. It's a natural thing in free software after all.
What's important is that fork must follow copyleft, so your
contributions are still in the common.

It is an issue. But I suppose that the OSMF had good reason to make the
change anyway. You might disagree and think this was the wrong strategy,
but that doesn't make OSMF terms bad per se.

This is not true. See the point about the vote and definition of active
contributor. There is contractual security.

FSFE also has something similar with the Fiduciary License Agreement.
Sometimes, it's needed for free software project to manage their rights:
