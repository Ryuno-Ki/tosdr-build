2012 =E0 22:25 -0700, James Michael Dupont a
<br>=E9crit :
<br>&gt; Hello,
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; I would like raise an issue here, many sites dont have a TOS direc=
tly they=20
<br>&gt; use creative commons copyleft or another form of copyleft.
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; The argument is that this is not a contract you agree with, but a =
license=20
<br>&gt; you accept if you exercise it and create derived works.
<br>&gt; It is not a contract because you have no agreement between parties=
.=20
<br>
<br>That is largely dependent upon a very specific kind of contract law, an=
d
<br>even if you call them differently, it does not change anything. In
<br>Germany and in France, we call the GNU GPL a contract, even if it's a
<br>license. The only difference that you may have between contract and
<br>license is that in the contract it's an agreement where both parties ar=
e
<br>doing something (we call that "contrat synallagmatique" in French) and
<br>license an agreement where only one party is doing something and the
<br>other parties are just enjoying the benefits.
<br>
<br>Now, with the GPL, it's a license with conditions. You have to respect
<br>the conditions. So the distinction between license and contract is
<br>really subtle, and frankly only matters to legal discussions which are
<br>not really at core with our discussion here.
<br>
<br>As I wrote to you on twitter, copyleft has always been contractual, eve=
n
<br>if with "license" it doesn't say its name. Copyleft is not in the law,
<br>you have to write a legal text (a contract or license, whatever you cal=
l
<br>it, or terms) where you are creating your own set of conditions,
<br>supplementing conditions set forth by law.
<br>
<br>To put it simply, if you don't have the contract with copyleft, then yo=
u
<br>juste have the plain application of legal copyright (which isn't
<br>copyleft, because in copyright the author keeps the exclusive right to
<br>make copies, make changes to the work etc.)
<br>
<br>&gt; my point is that copyleft gives you greater freedom, for example t=
o share=20
<br>&gt; data from many sources with no contract with them. you can collect=
 these=20
<br>&gt; sources together.
<br>
<br>But you have to respect a set of conditions (copyleft conditions and
<br>other conditions)! Of course copyleft gives you greater freedom than
<br>copyright, that's the whole point.
<br>
<br>&gt; when you then introduce Contributor terms with the right to change=
 the=20
<br>&gt; license in the future such as osmf has done, the entire copyleft b=
reaks=20
<br>&gt; down because a third party cannot agree to the those terms.
<br>
<br>It really depends on what the contributor terms say! in the case of Ope=
n
<br>Street Map, they can only license them under free and open source
<br>licenses (ODBL and CC BY or CC BY SA -- I don't remember) or future
<br>licenses agreed by 2/3 of the active contributors.
<br>
<br>Copyright assignment or fiduciary agreements sometimes are necessary
<br>with copyright because you may need better way to manage the copyrights=
.
<br>For instance, look at Linux. There is no copyright assignment, no
<br>"contributor terms". The downside is that Linux is stuck with GPLv2
<br>forever! It's okay because GPLv2 and Linux are pretty straightfoward to
<br>deal with. But for Open street map it's way more complicated: database
<br>rights, etc.
<br>
<br>So again, you need to analyse what the Contributor terms say and so far=
,
<br>I don't understand your concerns over these terms as they only make
<br>possible the use of free/open licenses.
<br>
<br>[of course, the way OSMF dealt with the whole change is also a subject,
<br>but I don't know a lot about it]
