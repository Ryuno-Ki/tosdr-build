just found this review
http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/terms-conditions-app-nets-terms-of-service-privacy-policy-explained/
(on a blog that seems to have more reviews on there, so that's
useful!)

this is an interesting service to review because it aims to make a
change away from web2.0's "spying for free" business model, by making
it a paid service. this is interesting at least as a social experiment
to see how people react to that proposition, and also to raise this
important discussion.

otoh, they are still of course a proprietary and centralized platform,
so they have also gotten some criticism for that, and at first glance
from the above-mentioned blogpost it seems they may change ToS
single-sidedly at any time, which is something we have been rating
negatively in other services so far.

cheers,
Michiel.
