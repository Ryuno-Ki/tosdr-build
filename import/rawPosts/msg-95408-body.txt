Hi,=20

This is a kind of comment that we had a lot. This might be a cultural
difference, but I would lie to know what you think.

Most of the time, my reasoning for rating these as "bad" is that for a
lot of people, using a pseudonym is the only way to enjoy freedom of
expression, usually because of their profession, etc.  Unless there's a
valid reason for requiring the legal name to be published, I don't
really see why we should consider it "a good thing."

Comments welcome.

PS: we usually don't give a big weight to these, right now it's 10 out
of 100.
