again, that's meaningless if they get to define the purposes. maybe they=20
have a purpose of a 5-year analysis of demographics, and are keeping your=
=20
data for that purpose. if you close your account, your data should be gone=

within a time that's technically reasonable.

i agree, they need to have some elbow room to respond to take down notices,=
=20
but they could just deactivate the account or the specific file, but still=
=20
allowing the user to retrieve (the rest of) their data before everything is=
=20
deleted.

often, take down notices are against hacked accounts of innocent victims,=
=20
for instance. so giving -25 in 'suspension' topic for this.

also they may change the terms at any time, send you an email about it, but=
=20
they don't say anything about giving notice. giving -25 in 'changes'

the weights are still quite random, i'll adjust them later by calibrating=
=20
them per-topic across services. After that, they can guide us in assigning=
=20
classes.

added this in staging=20
now http://didnotread.github.com/didnotread.org/#owncube will push it after=
=20
adding some missing details, like the logo png and the link to the terms.

Ciao!
