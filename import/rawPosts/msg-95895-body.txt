When you visit CouchSurfing.org while logged into facebook, on the
main page it shows you which of your facebook friends are using
CouchSurfing. Regrettably this is quite common practice nowadays, so
probably we shouldn't let this weigh too heavy, but that doesn't make
it right, so i do think we should list it as a data point.
