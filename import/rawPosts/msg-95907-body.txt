no, because they are the ones who share this information with
facebook, facebook is just saying a big smiling 'thank you' to them
(and to millions of other sites).

btw, Like buttons also track you if you are not logged in or do not
even have an account. a responsible website does not display any third
party tracking tools. regrettably, there are very few responsible
websites apart from wikipedia, duckduckgo and probably a few others,
so we can't be too harsh on CouchSurfing for not being on that elite
list. but i still think we should mention it. if that makes sense.
