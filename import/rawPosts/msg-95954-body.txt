btw, it is also mentioned in the privacy policy that this goes both
ways: they give data to facebook, but also receive data from facebook,
that they then cross-reference with other data they already collected
about you:

"Information We Collect from Other Sources

We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that
with information we collect through our Services. For example, if you
create or log into your CouchSurfing account through a third-party
social networking site, we will have access to certain information
from that site, such as your name, profile picture, connections and
other account information in accordance with the authorization
procedures determined by such third-party social networking site."
