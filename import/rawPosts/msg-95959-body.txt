"may retain certain information as required by law, for legitimate
business purposes and to protect member safety."

the 1st and 3rd sound reasonable to me, the 2nd one doesn't. if i
delete my account, and they don't need the data because of some
requirement by law or to protect member safety, and they have had time
to flush their caches, then the data should be gone and no longer be
kept by them, regardless of what purposes they have for their
business.
