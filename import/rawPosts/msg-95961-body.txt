i think promotional communications should be opt-in, not opt-out

"Promotional Communications
You may opt out of receiving promotional emails from CouchSurfing by
following the instructions in those emails or by adjusting the
appropriate settings in your profile. If you opt out, we may still
send you transactional or relationship messages, such as emails about
your account."
