this seems ok to me, but it's a bit weird that they ask Californians
to contradict some Californian laws, so i wanted to mention it:

"4.5 Release. Because our Services are merely a platform, in the event
that you have a dispute with one or more members, you release us (and
our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates)
from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every
kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected,
disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with
such disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive California
Civil Code 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to
claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his
favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must
have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.""
