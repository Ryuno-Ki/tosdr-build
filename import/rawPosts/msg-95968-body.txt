is this bad or ok?

"SUBMISSIONS

We welcome questions, comments, suggestions and ideas about
CouchSurfing and our Services ("Submissions"). If you provide a
Submission, you agree that it is non-confidential (unless CouchSurfing
states otherwise in writing) and shall become the sole property of
CouchSurfing. CouchSurfing shall own exclusive rights, including all
intellectual property rights, and shall be entitled to the
unrestricted use and dissemination of Submissions for any purpose,
commercial or otherwise. You acknowledge that CouchSurfing is not
obligated to provide acknowledgment or compensation to you in exchange
for Submissions."

it would be nice if they would say thank you if you give them an idea
and the implement it. see for instance how github do it:
https://help.github.com/articles/responsible-disclosure-of-security-vulnerabilities

also, it's common practice to pay like 100 bucks for a good bug report
if it's concerning a security vulnerability and it's handled in a
responsible way by the person reporting it. and a good way to thank
someone for their contribution(s) is often to hire them. :)

anyway, i wouldn't assign a weight to this one before we compare it to
other services, let's see what the common practice is, and compare it
to that.
