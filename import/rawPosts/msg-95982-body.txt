that's weird. fair enough that 'couchsurfing' may be a trademark, but
how can a website prohibit other websites to link to it? that breaks
the architecture of the web.

"You are granted a limited, non-exclusive right to create a text
hyperlink to the Services, provided such link does not portray
CouchSurfing or any of our services in a false, misleading, derogatory
or otherwise defamatory manner and provided further that the linking
site does not contain any adult or illegal material or any material
that is offensive, harassing or otherwise objectionable. This limited
right may be revoked at any time."

Is their website's URL so precious that it shall go unspoken? I
understand they have a right not to be spoken about in a hateful or
misleading way (that should be covered by libel, hate speak and
similar law, right?), but i don't think they can forbid other people
to speak about them just because they say in their terms that they may
revoke the right to link to them at any time. i wonder why this clause
is there?
