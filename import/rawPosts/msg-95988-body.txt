as i understand this section:

15.3 If you are (a) located in, under the control of, or a national or
resident of any country to which the United States has embargoed goods
or services, (b) identified as a "Specially Designated National", or
(c) placed on the Commerce Department=92s Denied Persons List, you
represent and warrant that you will not engage in financial
transactions with, or commercial activities on, CouchSurfing
(including making payments in connection with any identity
verification tools provided by CouchSurfing). Without limiting the
foregoing, you are solely responsible for determining whether you have
complied with travel restrictions to and from certain countries,
including travel to and from countries other than the U.S.

and this information about the US embargo against Cuba:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_embargo_against_Cuba

it would be illegal to use CouchSurfing if you hold a Cuban passport.
is that true? Please correct me if i'm wrong in interpreting this
clause, but that's what it looks like to me.

now, regardless of which country we're all from and what our
governments agree or disagree on with each other, it would be nice if
i could use CouchSurfing just because i'm a human being, and not
because of my nationality.

I understand that this is a result of them being only located in the
US, and i know for instance Dropbox has the same problem, but for
instance Facebook has offices in the US and in Ireland, meaning all
humans can use it, regardless of nationality.

Curious what other people think of this. :)
