yeah i think i got that right, see:

Nice they actually mention us as a grassroots forum that could help
raise awareness and exert pressure! :)

They say the copyright license is too broad, it would be illegal in
Germany as well as in the EU in general (but that doesn't matter
because they're in the US).

Zeit.de also got a reply from the CEO of CouchSurfing, in which he
says that the clause is necessary to combat fraud.
