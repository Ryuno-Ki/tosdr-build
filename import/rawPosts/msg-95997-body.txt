Subject: Re: [Bad] CouchSurfing may retain your data after deactivation for
 legitimate business purposes

the CEO of CouchSurfing says they will actually hold data from already
closed accounts in order to help them combat fraud on the platform.

i think that's reasonable as long as it's only accessible to employees
who are conducting that specific anti-fraud research, and are under
NDA about the data they have access to as because of their role. if it
would say 'will stay available to the anti-fraud team' that would be a
lot more specific than saying 'legitimate business purposes'.

What do other people think about this?
