I think that it may be important to look into the ability of deleting an account while ensuring that no one can claim ownership of the corresponding user id after the original owner has deleted his/her account.

After seeing this as an issue with Hotmail (recent news, I believe), it may be important to look for any indications of this as a possibility in TOSs.

Is it possible to file this as an "issue" on GitHub? It does not seem to be appropriate for the website repository, so I figured I'd bring it up here.
