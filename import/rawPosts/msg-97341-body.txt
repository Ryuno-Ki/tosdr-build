hi! yes, this is the correct way to bring it up. github issues are
only for bugs in the website's code, the content it displays is
entirely derived from the threads on this mailing list.

in fact, if you click on any of the 'Expand' buttons, you will see
exactly to which mailing list thread each data point is traced back
(the 'discussion' links).

i think in cases where an account is an identity, as is definitely the
case for an email provider like Hotmail, then it's good if there is a
grace period in which the identifier of a closed account remains
'squatted', to prevent risk of identity theft.

So i think it's good if a service would offer such a grace period, but
we would have to see which ones do and which ones don't, and whether
anything about this is said in the actual ToS you agree to, or whether
this is an 'additional' data point about how services behave in
practice, regardless of what the ToS agreement binds them to.

Do you have a link to the news article you refer to?
