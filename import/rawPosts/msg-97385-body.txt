http://tos-dr.info/#app-net-tosdr is wrong. It currently states:


=93App.net reserves the right to change or modify any of the terms and cond=
itions contained in the Site Terms or any policy or guideline of the Sites,=
 at any time and in its sole discretion. Any changes or modification will b=
e effective immediately upon posting of the revisions on the Sites, and you=
 waive any right you may have to receive specific notice of such changes or=
 modifications. Your continued use of the Sites following the posting of ch=
anges or modifications will confirm your acceptance of such changes or modi=
fications.=94


This is not true. The current terms state:


We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. For instance, we ma=
y need to change these Terms if we come out with a new feature or for some =
other reason.

Whenever we make changes to these Terms, the changes are effective 5 days a=
fter we post such revised Terms to our website (indicated by revising the d=
ate at the top of these Terms), or when we notify you of the changes by e-m=
ail or other means, or upon your acceptance if we provide a mechanism for y=
our immediate acceptance of the revised Terms (such as a click-through conf=
irmation or acceptance button). It is your responsibility to check the webs=
ite regularly for changes to these Terms.

If you continue to use the Service after the revised Terms go into effect, =
then you have accepted the changes to these Terms.


So it's 5 days after posting, and in some cases you will be notified. You a=
lso agree that it's your responsibility to stay up to date. As there is htt=
ps://github.com/appdotnet/terms-of-service I think there are plenty of reso=
urces for users to do so, so I would change this from mediocre to notice (a=
t least).
