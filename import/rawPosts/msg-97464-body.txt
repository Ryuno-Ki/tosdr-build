It is not up to Oracle.  US law places these restrictions and many others on 
certain nations and their nationals.  Whether or not one agrees, Oracle must 
comply or suffer serious penalties.  It would be nice if states all got along with 
one another, but I know of no time in the past 10,000 or so years of city-states 
and nation-states when no states were fighting.  C'est la vie.
