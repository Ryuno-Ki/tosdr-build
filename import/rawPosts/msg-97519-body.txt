You're right, this is no longer discussing the federatedness of
identica and joindiaspora, but it's also not a bugfix ticket, so
probably easiest to have a separate thread about how we should deal
with "additional" data points: things that matter but that don't
directly point to a paragraph in the documents a user accepts.

We'll leave this thread in 'disputed' state for now.
