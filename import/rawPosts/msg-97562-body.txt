Some of those fall into the Privacy Policy category. But yeah, a lot of ToS 
provisions are just in case and are rarely used by the service.

<br>I think these points should have a smaller impact than the things you
<br>are actually made to accept legally. We should also only review these
<br>points if we have objectively quantifiable data, never based on one
<br>single occurrence for instance. We should only focus on online user
<br>rights, so topics like privacy, freedom of speech, freedom to use and
<br>choose technology. Not topics like pricing, usability, features,
<br>etcetera.
<br>
<br>And i think we should clearly mark these additional data points as
<br>such, so that it's obvious to the user whether or not something is
<br>part of the contract or not.
<br>
<br>When we just got started, we had only one such type of data point (the
<br>one about federated free software), and made it a search filter
<br>instead of a data point. But now i already listed 10, so having 10
<br>filter checkboxes is no longer feasible. Also not mentioning good
<br>points or bad points about a service that do affect our rights a
<br>online users, would give an incomplete view. So i propose to display
<br>them in a separate list, as 'additional data points'.
<br>
<br>For instance, if you look at twitter, there are 10 data points, of
<br>which probably about half are 'additional' in the sense that you
<br>cannot point at a specific paragraph in any of their legally binding
<br>terms or policy texts.
<br>
<br>Curious what other people think about this.
