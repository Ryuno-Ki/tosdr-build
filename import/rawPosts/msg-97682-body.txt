you're right. Hugo also mentioned that these three:

>> - do they answer to questions
>> - are their terms easy to read
>> - do they change the terms often

are special because they are /about/ the contract you agree to, and
the way in which you agree to it. we can call those three 'meta'
instead of 'additional'.

Yeah, that's exactly my point, i guess. That makes it harder for us to
provide a good useful review, because a lot of the things that we can
be very concrete about (the actual text that constitutes the
agreement) can sometimes be very theoretical and irrelevant to what
actually happens in practice with our online rights.

Also, some clauses will be illegal in some countries, and it's hard to
judge when this is the case, and how to deal with it when it is.

But i guess we'll find our balance as the project comes of age and our
knowledge base fills up with more examples we can refer to.

For now i'll mark data points with a 'reference' field that can take
the value 'direct', 'meta' or 'additional', depending on whether:

- (direct): a data points refers directly to a passage in either the
ToS or the PP or one of the other documents you agree to as a user,
- (meta): a data point refers to how the user's agreement is obtained
(readability of the text, frequency, lead time and notification
methods of changes, clearly displayed contact information, etcetera)
- (additional): a data point objectively describes a relevant aspect
of how the service treats the rights of their users, but this does not
fall in any of the previous two categories.

I will then also mark all 'additional' data points as disputed for
now, so that only 'direct' and 'meta' data points show up on the
website.

Also, given the size of our categorizing backlog (i'm still
categorizing discussions that happened in July), i'll first categorize
the 'direct' data points about the most well-known services, and leave
data points about more niche services, and additional data points
(which are currently all disputed anyway), for later.

I hope you can all find agreement with this approach, if not then
please let me know! :)


Cheers,
Michiel
