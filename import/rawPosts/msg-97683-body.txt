right, i can imagine two reasons why they put this in - especially because 
of the preceding paragraph, it might be because of the 'false, misleading, 
derogatory or otherwise defamatory manner' in which you link to them.

it could indeed also be because if you deeplink than you could basically 
scrape their site and make a profit by making information available that 
they hold copyright on and you do not.

in particular, there is a common practice in file sharing to set up one 
site that "only" holds the links and a separate site that "only" hosts the 
data, with the goal that none of the two are actually fully "hosting" the 
(possibly copyright-infringing) files - one is only hosting links and the 
other is only hosting data blobs. i think that's a different issue though.

anyway, we can guess at why that clause is there, but the best way to find 
out is just to ask them. They are proposing this agreement, so hopefully 
they can comment on its content. I'll see what i can find out and post back 
here on this thread.

Cheers,
Michiel.
