wait they say 'we will notify you, including by revising 
the date at the top of this policy' - does that mean that they will notify 
you pro-actively *as well as* changing the date on the document, or that 
they consider changing the date on the document to be sufficient 
notification?

I had read it the first way originally, but now re-reading it i think they 
mean the latter. Good thing we have tosback2 running the automated crawls 
to detect whenever services change their ToS. :)
