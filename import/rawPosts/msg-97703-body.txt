of course a service can ask you to provide your real legal information to=
=20
them, so that they know who they are dealing with. This will probably=20
almost always be the case for a paid service, where they will need to know=
=20
your billing address and use the law and the plain-old-banking-system to=20
get their money from you.

When a system works as a general identity provider (like blogging=20
applications, email providers, and social networks), then i think it would=
=20
be nice if they allow you to use an online identity that doesn't directly=
=20
link to your real life. This (pseudonymity) can be important for freedom of=
=20
speech, as well as for privacy protection (the latter mainly if people=20
become famous online, but prefer to lead a normal private life in the real=
=20
world without paparazzi in their garden).

They are two different things, of course.

About the second one, there are situations where a service makes a=20
reference to the real world, for instance ride sharing services,=20
CouchSurfing/AirBnb/BeWelcome-like "accomodation sharing" services (is=20
there a better collective name for those?), and online advertising/selling=
=20
services like ebay and craigslist. There, i would say the services do not=
=20
act as your online identity provider, but rather as real-world-related=20
tools. So we should take that into account.

Putting that together, i can see three types of data points:
- a service asks for your legal identity for billing purposes but will not=
=20
share it publically
- a real-world-related service forbids pseudonyms
- an online identity service forbids pseudonyms.

It's mainly the third one that we should rate as bad i think, the other two=
=20
we should just note to record the fact that we've seen it and categorized=
=20
it as such.
