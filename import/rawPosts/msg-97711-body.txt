this point is also reviewed in Andrew Clout's blogpost about App.Net by the=
=20
way. The blogpost states 'if you use the service, you agree to the terms=20
[...] To be a safe, vigilant user, you need to pay attention to changes to=
=20
the terms of service =97 because if you keep using the service after they=
=20
change, then you have agreed to the new terms by default.' and seems to=20
conclude that this is acceptable. i think it would be nice if a service=20
 commits to pro-actively notifying their users. If it's impossible for a=20
user to read all the terms of services they sign up for, then it's=20
definitely impossible to re-read them every 5 days. EFF's tosback2, of=20
which we now also run an instance, partially fixes that, but 5 days is very=
=20
little time for us to detect the changes, get someone on the case, review=
=20
the changes, post them discuss them, and rate them.

So i would still say that to get full points, a service (any service, in=20
general) should pro-actively inform users of a change, and give them, say,=
=20
two weeks to review the changes at leisure and to make an informed decision=
=20
about whether to accept the changes or leave the service (which in itself=
=20
will presumably take some time to do) before being held to the changed=20
terms.
