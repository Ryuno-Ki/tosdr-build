yeah, i think it's reasonable for a US-based company to claim it would be a 
lot of effort to make their service accessible world-wide, and therefore 
they can't do it. Maybe we should approach this positively and give 
positive points to companies (like Google in China for instance) who make 
an extra effort to be available to all humans.

Another interesting point i saw was that App.Net doesn't seem to have a 
'Cuba clause' in their ToS, even though they are based in the US. Does 
anyone know why that may be? What would happen if a Cuban resident were to 
sign up for an App.Net account?
