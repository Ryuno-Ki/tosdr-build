i'll keep the points from this blogpost inside this thread, to avoid a spam=
=20
explosion of one-message threads. if any of these points lead to=20
discussion, we can fork them out.

we already had two data points about App.Net:
- they provide an archive of their=20
ToS https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/tosdr/I7i-2EM0GVY
- changes published 5 days ahead (but without pro-active=20
notification) https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/tosdr/MCGx3DtQHM8/J13IJ=
AikOTAJ

from the blogpost, i think we can extract the following extra ones:

1 - they request feedback from users=20
(see https://github.com/appdotnet/terms-of-service/issues as well as the=20
blue box at the top of their terms https://alpha.app.net/legal/terms/ )

2 - simple and easy to follow (i agree)

3 - pseudonyms allowed, good! i agree! this is an online identity provider,=
=20
so keeping your personal life separate from your online life is important,=
=20
and it's good that (unlike e.g. Facebook and Google+), App.Net allows this.

4 - you are responsible for what you upload, and some types of content are=
=20
not allowed. specifically (the blog post mentions this further down under=
=20
'Copyright'), if you post copyrighted material to which you have no=20
license, they will take it down and close your account

5 - the copyright license you give them is "limited" - good! the terms also=
=20
state: "Aside from our limited right to your content, you retain all of=20
your rights to the content"

6 - if you delete content, it is hidden from view immediately, and deleted=
=20
entirely from their servers in max. 2 weeks. "It is then gone forever." -=
=20
good!

7 - "breach of any of the rules outlined in the terms of service =97=20
including those above =97 may result in you losing your App.net account, an=
d=20
access to the service." - that's good because it's conditional on there=20
being a reason to terminate your account. a lot of other services claim the=
=20
right to terminate your account for any reason and/or at their sole=20
discretion.

8 - their technology is proprietary, as is their logo and name, and you may=
=20
not extract the content from their website. They state this under the=20
"App.Net's Content" section, but it seems to also cover the content that=20
other users upload. The blogpost doesn't explicitly pick on that last part,=
=20
and i think that although this last part is unfair if you view them as a=20
hosting provider, it is probably fair if you view them as a closed=20
platform. that is, if a person publishes through App.Net, that content is=
=20
not considered to have been published to the web in general, it is=20
considered to have been published specifically to App.Net, and so App.Net=
=20
mark their territory around that user content. A competing service may not=
=20
scrape and republish it, regardless of whether the user who wrote and owns=
=20
the content would allow that competing service to do so.

9 - App.net does not take responsibility for what its users post, whether=
=20
on App.Net, or on website that have an inbound or outbound hyperlink with=
=20
out.

10 - the review of the legal stuff is interesting, i would like to know=20
also what Hugo and others think of this. I have read the all-caps part=20
twice, and the second time it seemed to state that as a user you cannot sue=
=20
them, except for the 50 dollars (or whatever 12 month fee) you paid. It=20
does not mention class action lawsuits, but i'm not entirely sure where the=
=20
line is and how we should judge this. Given my own limited understanding of=
=20
this topic, we need to discuss it further to reach a clear conclusion, i=20
think.

11 - (info) court of law is California (btw, this did make me wonder why=20
they have no 'Cuba clause', see separate thread:=20
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/tosdr/G8w02Z3RKRw ). the way=20
disputes are settled are also described in the blogpost.

I'll ask Andrew to comment whether he feels this is an accurate selection=
=20
of data points extracted from his blog post.


Cheers!
Michiel
