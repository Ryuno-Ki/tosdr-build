we need to choose some consistent weights for this though, there are quite=

a few services that have a clause like this. As a first approximation i=20

20 extra if it says 'defend and indemnify', and another 20 if it survives=

the termination of the agreement?

for now i'll apply this weighing to 500px, soundcloud, github, twitpic,=20
steam and app.net, and then we can apply it to future reviews as we do them=

i'll count "defend, indemnify and hold us harmless" as synonymous to "defen=

and indemnify", hope that's correct
