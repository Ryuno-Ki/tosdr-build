i guess the idea is that once it's uploaded through twitpic, you would have 
to credit both twitpic and the author/owner, except when it's a retweet, 
because then the author is automatically credited, and the tweet itself 
will already point to twitpic.
 
this is also relevant and gives some context about why this is such a big 
deal:
