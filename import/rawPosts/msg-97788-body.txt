[2]

I think [2] is OK, a thumbs up Grade B.  It is not "personally" identifiabl=
e.  They collect statistics about how many games and which games are instal=
led on that account, what are the hardware specs on that account, how many =
hours on each game have been played on that account, what are the game cate=
gories that the account mostly plays and buys.  Using this information, a S=
team Store page is customized for the account holder for featured games and=
 community groups that the account holder might enjoy or be likely to purch=
ase.

All of the above is a GOOD THING that allows a customized personal approach=
, without connecting "personally" identifiable information to the collected=
 statistical data other than connecting it to an internal Steam Account ID =
(a number) and a users' postal code.  (I called them and asked, but that is=
 verbal and not written...ideally, the above info would be written as such)=
 ... so grade B.  If it were written as such and more clear...then grade A.
