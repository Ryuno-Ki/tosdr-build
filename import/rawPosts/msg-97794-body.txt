At least under US law, one cannot hold a copyright on historical or 
newsworthy fact or "information", only on the aggregation or expression (the 
gathering and writing).  Apparently they seek to protect something not 
protected by copyright, and to do so by contract--by TOS.  If one does what 
the Web consists of--hyperlinking--they will prohibit you from using their site.  
But the links will remain.
