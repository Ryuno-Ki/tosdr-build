------=_Part_572_12076426.1349177941845
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

as a first classification, i propose the following weights out of 100:

if a service can change the terms with immediate effect, -60
if don't notify users proactively, but do give at least 3 days of lead 
time: -30
if they also notify users: 0
if they notify users at least 14 days ahead of changes: +30

On a related note, there are a few sites (app.net, wikipedia, bewelcome) 
that invite users to give their opinion about their terms of service. I 
think we should introduce a new topic 'dialogue' for this, and give +50 to 
services who do this.

Please let me know your thoughts.


Cheers,
Michiel
