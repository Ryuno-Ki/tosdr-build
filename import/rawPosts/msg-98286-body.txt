as an exercise, let's try to use this to for the clauses we have
started assigning standards weights to, for changes:

- terms may change at any time with immediate effect, and it is your
responsibility to discover this
- term changes are published silently X days in advance, you will not
be notified
- you will be notified, but the effect is immediate from the moment
the notification is sent
- you will be notified at least X days in advance

I would map all of these to
http://www.commonterms.net/patterns/change_of_terms/at_providers_discretion

and for indemnification:

- you will defend, indemnify them [, and hold them harmless] and this
survives the termination of the agreement
- you will indemnify them (but no mention of defending them)
- you will indemnify them (but no mention of defending them) and this
survives the termination of the agreement

I would map all four of these to
http://www.commonterms.net/patterns/indemnity/procedure_described

How can we distinguish them? i think it's clear we need to add
something more here, but it's not totally clear to me what or how yet.

I will think about it myself as well. P=E4r, other, what do you think?


Cheers,
Michiel
