from our irc chat room:

"Lara> Hi, I was looking at http://tos-dr.info/#apple and am pretty
sure Apple ID and/or iCloud accounts can't be deleted if anyone wants
to add this to this page.  It's annoying because there are one or two
Apple IDs I want to delete but can't."

let's investigate that! :)


Cheers,
Michiel
