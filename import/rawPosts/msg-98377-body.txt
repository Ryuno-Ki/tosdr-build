Hello,

Delicious being *bad* rated, I looked for an alternative service to move in=
: Kippt. Here are the ToS:
https://kippt.com/privacy/

Before singing in I made a Ctrl+F (or Option+F) on the terms =ABdelete=BB, =
and =ABclose=BB, and =ABcancel=BB, nothing found. So I read. I found nothin=
g on this topic on their page.

I had to sign in (giving my email address) then log in, then I went to Sett=
ings>Account Settings>Cancel my account to read:
"You're about to delete your account. Please remember that once you delete =
your account you will loose your data (it's kind of serious business right =
there).
You can always export your clips before deleting your account."
OK, but IMHO that's not legal terms.

I think that is a bad practice.

Regards,

V
