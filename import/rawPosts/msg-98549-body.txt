Found via Hugo's post on the opennotice list -

At least some of the points mentioned here:
http://moneyland.time.com/2012/08/28/7-surprising-things-lurking-in-online-terms-of-service-agreements/#ixzz28EDtiWA9
are not in our data points yet. Also it's a good opinion to use when
assigning weights.

And on a side note - as suggested by
http://www.switchfast.com/switchfast-blog/2012/8/30/how-to-assess-a-terms-of-service-agreement-without-really-trying.aspx
once we have worked through our backlog, we could probably
double-check all sites for these 7 points (as well as for each topic
on http://tos-dr.info/topics.html ) before we assign a class to them,
so we don't leave any questions unanswered. Just to make sure
everything is there, all our reviews our thorough.


Cheers,
Michiel
