Hi Michiel,
thanks for your efforts!

Primarily, I want to say that the CommonTerms database is by no means final
(and will never be).
If you stumble upon a term/clause that does not map well onto any
CommonTerms pattern, you should add a new pattern.
There will be a tool for that, I am working on it right now. Later on an
API, too, in case you don't like the tool.

Secondly, however, I (non-lawyer) would say that some of your clauses
actually do exist in the CommonTerms database. Will indicate them below.
But since you did not find them, others won't either. This is a challenge.
It would not be good if the database grows wildly with multiple equivalent
or almost equivalent patterns appearing under different headings. The
database can be browsed by hierarchy and searched by keyword, but probably
alternative formulations should be added for better searchability.

Best regards
P=E4r

&gt;&gt; service).<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Right now, we are not reflecting that, as data point texts are jus=
t<br>
&gt;&gt; free texts. But we could start doing that, and that way we would b=
uild<br>
&gt;&gt; up a valuable ontology of typical data points that we see recurrin=
g a<br>
&gt;&gt; lot.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Once we have such a list, sites could pro-actively auto-review<br>
&gt;&gt; themselves, and in particular, if sites use templated ToS texts li=
ke<br>
&gt;&gt; the ones Docracy works on, then these could come pre-reviewed with=
<br>
&gt;&gt; such standardized data point texts. The weighing would then still<=
br>
&gt;&gt; depend on the specific service type, although even that could defa=
ult<br>
&gt;&gt; to a common suggested value.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Of course you could also then try to detect commonly used phrases =
in<br>
&gt;&gt; ToS texts, trying to treat human-readable texts as if they were<br=
>
&gt;&gt; machine-readable, but that&#39;s another extra step. For now just<=
br>
&gt;&gt; standardizing the data point texts would already be a very valuabl=
e<br>
&gt;&gt; thing, i think.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Thanks Veronica Par and others on the confcall for the suggestion!=
