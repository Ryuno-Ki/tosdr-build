The below is from the Terms of Use displayed when running Skype for the 
first time (May 2009 update).  There is no requirement for them to update 
you of changes, and you implicitly accept revisions after 30 days.  At 
least one could check the terms for changes every 30 days, but it's really 
not ideal.


"5.4 New Versions: Skype reserves the right to change this Agreement at any 
time by publishing the revised Agreement on the Skype Website. The revised 
Agreement shall become effective within thirty (30) days of such 
publication, unless You expressly accept the revised Agreement earlier by 
clicking on the accept button. Your express acceptance or Your continued 
use of the Skype Software after expiry of the notice period of thirty (30) 
days, shall constitute Your acceptance to be bound by the terms and 
conditions of the revised Agreement. You can find the latest version of 
this Agreement at http://www.skype.com/legal/eula . Skype reserves the 
right to change any of the Additional Terms from time to time and such 
changes shall become effective either within thirty (30) days of 
publication of the revised version on the Skype Website (unless You 
expressly accept the revised terms earlier by clicking on the accept button 
if this option is made available), or within the timeframe set out in the 
applicable terms if different."
