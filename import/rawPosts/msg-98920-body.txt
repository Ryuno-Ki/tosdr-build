I don't think it's the right way to measure them. What matters I think
is the scope that triggers the obligation to indemnify. For instance, if
it's all activities related to anything that has a link to your content,
that's really bad. If it's related to your action directly, it's
different. Also if it's "any claims" from anybody, it can be too large
etc. But these need legal analysis, not random picking.

I don't think that's a good idea. We should have a precise comparative
analysis before.
