Hi, Michiel. I'd like to highlight three things about the blog post -- one 
point I think is in error, one I think will not be useful for ToS:DR unless 
we approach it in a more fine-tuned way, and one I think will be very 
useful indeed.

The first point, "Your Photos May Be For Sale," suggests, erroneously, that 
if a Terms of Service agreement reserves the right to *publicly display *copyrighted 
material (such as photos), that's a bad thing. This could not be more 
wrong: any site that's hosting copyrighted material *must* reserve the 
right to publicly display that material. Otherwise, it won't have the right 
to, you know, display that material publicly. Like, on the internet. The 
right to public display doesn't affect whether or not a website can sell 
its users' content; the ability to sublicense or transfer the rights 
granted by the ToS does. If you're concerned about an online service 
selling your content, don't look for the right to publicly display, look 
for the right to sublicense and transfer. 

*Caveat: nearly every ToS grants the rights to sublicense and transfer, 
because most online services / websites would like the ability to be bought 
by a larger company. If an online service is bought, the value is in their 
content, and they need the ability to legally transfer that content to 
their new owner. 

The fifth point, "You Could Be Banned from Filing Class Action Lawsuits," 
is not incorrect, but is, according to the Supreme Court, the way things 
are supposed to work (I don't agree with them, but the Supreme Court 
doesn't often ask me). We have, in the US, a Federal Arbitration Act that 
is designed to take some of the burden off the court system and lower costs 
by encouraging arbitration. Some states, most notably California, had 
previously held that Terms of Service clauses requiring arbitration (thus 
shutting users out of filing lawsuits) were generally unfair, but the 
Supreme Court overturned that last year. In short: the vast majority of 
Terms of Service will have clauses requiring arbitration, after the Supreme 
Court's ruling. I suggest, for the purposes of ToS: DR, you don't have a 
blanket "Arbitration yes/no" checkbox, because that won't help anyone. 
Instead, look at the *terms* of the arbitration clause. Is the arbitration 
clause overly burdensome on the user? Does it require the user to travel to 
a certain state to arbitrate, for instance?

Finally, the seventh point, "Whether the Terms Are Fair or Not, They Could 
Change At Any Moment," is one I think ToS: DR should really highlight. 
There have been a number of court cases (*Roling v. E*Trade Securities LLC*; 
*Harris v. Blockbuster, Inc*; *Douglas v. U.S. Dist. Court ex rel Talk 
America*) holding that companies that claim the ability to change their 
Terms of Service without getting a new assent from their users are creating 
an unenforceable illusory contract, a situation that could invalidate the 
entire changed terms. Companies that would like to change their Terms of 
Service must take steps to notify their users about material changes and 
allow their users to assent to the new agreement. This is something that 
would be very good to highlight, because if a company is not informing its 
users about material changes to its terms, both the users *and the company 
itself* are being harmed.
