Yes, exactly.

Well, I don't think it makes it less bad. Look at Instagram's copyright
license. It doesn't include sublicense and right to transfer. It didn't
prevent them from selling it 1 billion to facebook.

I think both should be taken into account.=20

It's not because the supreme court decided these clauses are valid that
it's making their clause fair for the user. In most cases, I'd say it's
not fair. We don't have class-actions in France, so I know how it feels
to see big corporations getting away with things because the potential
plaintiffs are simply all too small. Imagine if tomorrow, Facebook or
Google ask their users to waive their right to file a class-action. How
would people react, considering that it's thanks to class-action
lawsuits that their privacy issues have been taken to court?

Totally.
