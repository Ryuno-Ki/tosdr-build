We should make a difference between "registration data" and data displayed 
to the public. So for instance if I have to provide my real name to the 
service I register with (it's not necessarily a bad thing) but it's a 
different issue if I cannot use a pseudonym on the service, on the public 
profile page etc.

Can someone check what's the status for yahoo's services? Do they allow you 
to just use a pseudonym or a "nickname" that's not necessarily your legal 
name?
