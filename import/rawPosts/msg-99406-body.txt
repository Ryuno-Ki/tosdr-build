Identi.ca is a federated social network using StatusNet software. Their 
site TOS are based on the original WordPress TOS.

Good:
All content is under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence, so it's 
openly available to use.
No name requirements
You can delete your account
Privacy policy states that private information (including your email 
address, phone number, and private messages) will not be shared with other 
users, business partners or the public.

Bad:
All content is under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence, so it's 
openly available to use, including the service using your content.

My own overall assessment is that it's a very fair TOS: while it allows the 
service to make use of user content, they can only do so on the same terms 
that anybody else can use the content. The Privacy Policy is solid as well.
