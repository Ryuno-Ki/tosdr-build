ok, i got a reply from them, what this is about is travel websites
that have 'accomodation search' linking to couchsurfing. they don't
want that to happen. they will not use this clause against you if you
just blog about them.

i guess this is about deeplinking to specific offers and/or iframing
couchsurfing's content in a context, not about linking to the
couchsurfing home page i think.

i think a couchsurfing offer is not a historical or newsworthy fact,
and i think this exposes the absurdity of web 2.0, where publishing
tools claim copyright over user content.

i guess they can prohibit other sites from quoting copyrighted
information only if they are the owners/authors, right? if they only
get a non-exclusive license to user content, then how can they have
anything to say over others displaying it?

can you prohibit other sites from deeplinking to specific search
results on your site?

i think there was a similar case where google was displaying tweets
from twitter as 'real time results' on their search results page, and
iirc, twitter was able to stop them from doing that.
