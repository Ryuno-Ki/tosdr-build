We should not get fooled. This is not what the clause says. This
interpretation is not binding and seems like just an excuse for terms of
bad quality.

The clause says linking, right? Is there a definition of linking
anywhere? If not, then assume it's the standard definition of linking,
i.e. to write somewhere on the web a <a
href=3D"http://couchsurfing.org">link</a>.

No because quoting text is covered by the exceptions to copyright law
(or fair use in the US).

IIRC there was an agreement between google and twitter, then they didn't
pursue it. But I think seriously this issue is getting too far. We're
trying to make assumptions, whereas if you read the clause in question,
it's rather simple and stupid. There was actually a website making fun
of all these silly clauses forbidding people to make links.

I propose, if we summarise this point, to write a title like:
        Absurd: they claim the right to forbid you to link to them
       =20
or something like this.
