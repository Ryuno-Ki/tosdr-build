Well. We don't have ToS per se.

The relevant legal information is at the bottom of the index page, but
it's more a disclaimer than anything else:
        *Nothing here should be considered legal advice.* We express our
        opinion with no guarantee and we do not endorse any service in
        any way. Please refer to a qualified attorney for legal advice.
        *Reading ToS;DR is in no way a replacement for reading the full
        terms to which you are bound.* Disclosure: a list of donors and
        supporters of Unhosted is published. DuckDuckGo has donated to
        the Unhosted project, before they knew about ToS;DR. All legal
        information and Imprint. http://tos-dr.info/legal.html
       =20
        ToS;DR is Free Software, licensed under the GNU Affero General
        Public License (AGPL-3.0). Offer for Source (zip). The .json
        data inside the services/ and points/ directories are also
        licensed under the Attribution - Share Alike (CC BY-SA 3.0).
        Icons by Glyphicons used under a CC BY 3.0 Unported license.
        Thumbs Up and Thumbs Down icons modified by Jan.

We do have some relevant pieces at http://tos-dr.info/legal.html
but they're not terms of service, just terms of contribution. There is a
short version on the google group page:
        In short: Your contributions will be available under free and
        open licences: the CC BY-SA 3.0 or later and the GNU AGPL-3.0 or
        later.
       =20
So this only concerns people who contribute, not people who only use the
service.=20

If somebody want to propose a point, please do. I cannot do it obviously
as I drafted the texts myself.
