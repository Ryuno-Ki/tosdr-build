Hi Hugo,

Martin (Gollowitzer) told me, that you collect information on terms of
service from online services.

Yesterday I made the effort to actually read the conditions of
kickstarter.com since I considered opening an account. After reading
what they want me to agree with I lost my desire to do it.

If I get everything right it basically states:
- They don't promise any reliability (that's normal unfortunately).
- Content can be changed or removed without any explanation at any time.
- Under no circumstances payments will be refunded.
- You need to waive all legal rights.
- They limit their responsibility to maximum USD 100.
- They do not even promise any data protection.
- Payments run via Amazon. Therefore they are not liable for anything
concerning payments.
- They refuse any liability and state, that they can under no conditions
be held accountable for any problems caused by using their services or
by not properly working services.

Since on kickstarter it's all about getting funds. I believe accepting
such conditions is very dangerous and could potentially not only lead to
high unexpected costs but as well to a serious loss of reputation.

Some quotes from their TOC:

"The Company may terminate your access to the Service, without cause or
notice, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all
information associated with your account. ... Any fees paid to the
Company are non-refundable."

"The Company reserves the right to, at any time, for any reason, and
without notice: (i) cancel, reject, interrupt, remove, or suspend a
campaign or project; (ii) remove, edit, or modify any Content,
including, but not limited to, any User Submission; and (iii) remove or
block any User or User Submission. Kickstarter reserves the right not to
comment on the reasons for any of these actions."

"The Service is provided =E2=80=9Cas is=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cas available=
=E2=80=9D and is without
warranty of any kind, express or implied, including, but not limited to,
the implied warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability, and
fitness for a particular purpose, and any warranties implied by any
course of performance or usage of trade, all of which are expressly
disclaimed. The Company, and its directors, employees, agents,
suppliers, partners, and content providers do not warrant that: (a) the
Service will be secure or available at any particular time or location;
(b) any defects or errors will be corrected; (c) any content or software
available at or through the Service is free of viruses or other harmful
components; or (d) the results of using the Service will meet your
requirements. Your use of the Service is solely at your own risk."

"The Company makes no guaranty of confidentiality or privacy of any
communication or information transmitted on the Site or any website
linked to the Site. The Company will not be liable for the privacy of
email addresses, registration and identification information, disk
space, communications, confidential or trade-secret information, or any
other Content stored on the Company=E2=80=99s equipment, transmitted over
networks accessed by the Site, or otherwise connected with your use of
the Service."

"In no event shall the Company, nor its directors, employees, agents,
partners, suppliers, or content providers, be liable under contract,
tort, strict liability, negligence, or any other legal or equitable
theory with respect to the service (i) for any lost profits, data loss,
cost of procurement of substitute goods or services, or special,
indirect, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages of any kind
whatsoever, substitute goods or services (however arising), (ii) for any
bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like (regardless of the source of
origination), or (iii) for any direct damages in excess of (in the
aggregate) one hundred U.S. dollars ($100.00)."

"You hereby irrevocably waive any right you may have to trial by jury in
any dispute, action, or proceeding."

Best regards,
Franz
