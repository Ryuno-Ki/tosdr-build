They need an incentive. This is on top of the fact that,\n<br>duh, companies don't want to be put in a\n<br>&gt;&gt; position where a competitor has access to their ToS.\n<br>&gt;&gt; I'd also like to mention that the quip about \"twenty-seventh grade\n<br>reading level\", while it might be accurate...there's just so much wrong\n<br>with readability scores, which is how they got that\n<br>&gt;&gt; information.\n<br>&gt;&gt; Readability scores are based on number of syllables, sentence length,\n<br>and document length. They have next to nothing to do with\n<br>&gt;&gt; comprehension. A young adult novel probably has a\n<br>&gt;&gt; higher-than-expected\n<br>&gt;&gt; readability score based on the ratios of syllables/sentence\n<br>&gt;&gt; length/document length, yet I doubt very many people have difficulty\n<br>understanding them.\n<br>&gt;&gt; Contracts are known to use obtuse and ambiguous language; but that is\n<br>actually a characteristic of legal language in general. More people know\n<br>how to recite the Miranda Warning than actually understand what it means,\n<br>and I can guarantee you that it isn't written at a\n<br>&gt;&gt; twenty-seventh grade reading level.\n<br>&gt;&gt; So while I like the initiative, I kind of wish they did a bit more\n<br>research before publishing this article. They totally miss the point as to\n<br>WHY people don't read contracts, and act like they would if they\n<br>&gt;&gt; were written in plain language. Maybe they would be more likely to do\n<br>so if they were written in plain language, but this article seems to\n<br>consider the only problem to be length and readability, but there's\n<br>actually much more to it than that.As a side note, and I'm seriously just\n<br>putting this out there for discussion, given that our goals seem to be\n<br>similar, it might be a good idea to start a discussion with them\n<br>&gt;&gt; on any kind of collaboration. After a brief glance, it looks more like\n<br>they look at paper contracts compared to our online services, but\n<br>still.

We are a crowd-reading project for\n<br>fineprint. We focus on online services, but there's no reason not to\n<br>include offline products like bank accounts etcetera. There is already a\n<br>fork for API services (basically, the business-to-business instead of\n<br>business-to-consumer version of online services).\n<br>&gt; we have been working on this for about a year, and already have\n<br>&gt; hundreds of data point. A data point is \"service X has a clause Y in\n<br>their terms of service, and that is good/bad/neutral\". Based on these data\n<br>points we rate all services from 'class A' (good fineprint) to 'class E'\n<br>(bad fineprint).\n<br>&gt; We got a lot of press attention in September, and raised about 25,000\n<br>USD through a crowdfunding campaign. All this money was paid by\n<br>&gt; individuals (and also a few companies), who care enough about this topic\n<br>to donate money in exchange for a few stickers or a T-shirt. We are now\n<br>using that money to run the project for about a year, and by that time we\n<br>will hopefully have an established and proven portfolio of reviews, and\n<br>will be able to get money for the next year in different ways (for\n<br>instance from foundations).\n<br>&gt; We are many volunteer reviewers, plus roughly 1 full-time \"curator\" (who\n<br>processes all the data we collect, and guards the quality and\n<br>consistency of our data points and reviews), and roughly 1 full-time\n<br>programmer.\n<br>&gt; We also joined in on the tosback project from eff, which checks\n<br>&gt; hundreds of websites each day to detect if any of them are silently\n<br>updating their contracts (ref. \"unilateral modification by the covered\n<br>entity to the disadvantage of the consumer without explicit consumer\n<br>consent after the execution of the contract.\")\n<br>&gt; so, i think we are the crowd-readers and programmers you are looking\n<br>for, let us know how you want to cooperate! :)\n<br>&gt; You can read everything about our project on <a href=\"http://tosdr.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://tosdr.org/</a>\n<br>&gt; Cheers,\n<br>&gt; Michiel\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br></blockquote></div>",
