  "text": "\n\nfrom http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/\n\n    Modifying and Terminating our Services\n\n    We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may\n    add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend\n    or stop a Service altogether.\n\n    You can stop using our Services at any time, although we’ll be\n    sorry to see you go. Google may also stop providing Services to\n    you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.\n\n    We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to\n    such data is important. If we discontinue a Service, where\n    reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice\n    and a chance to get information out of that Service. \n\nSo we have to distinguish two cases:\n\n - Google stops a service to all users\n    (Read: https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tosdr/PD5ZWzgv2RI/discussion )\n\n - Google stops a service to you\n\nThe \"reasonable advance notice\" only applies to the first case,\nnot the latter. So without further details from the terms, it's\nfair to draw the conclusion that Google can stop providing a\nservice to you at any time, without giving you a reason or\nanything. At least, they don't say that they can stop providing a\nservice \"for no reason\" or \"for any reason\" but to be completely\nsilent about it might not make things easy for the user.\n\nThis looks similar to Github and Netflix (but not exactly the\nsame)\n\n  - https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tosdr/hI5Too_uDVk/discussion\n  - https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tosdr/L5pl0Vn9lKY/discussion\n\nSo I propose to sum it up like this:\n\nGoogle may stop providing services to you at any time\n\n“Google may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create\nnew limits to our Services at any time.” Google has no obligation\nfrom the terms to give you notice in advance or to give a reason\nfor that termination.\n\ntopic: http://tosdr.org/topics.html#suspension\nscore: 40\npoint: mediocre\n\n\n-- \nHugo Roy, Project Lead\nTerms of Service; Didn't Read | www.tosdr.org\n\n\n-- \nHugo Roy, Project Lead\nTerms of Service; Didn't Read | www.tosdr.org\n\n-- \ntosdr.org | twitter.com/tosdr | github.com/tosdr\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n",
