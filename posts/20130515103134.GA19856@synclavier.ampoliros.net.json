  "text": "\nWhen you subscribe to the Sony Network (the PlayStation network\nand Sony's music and video network; similar to Netflix I guess),\nyou are bound to arbitration.\n\nThe terms have a warning at the beginning:\n\n    http://www.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com/terms-of-service/\n\n    NOTE: THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION\n    AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISION IN SECTION 17 THAT AFFECTS\n    YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO ANY \"DISPUTE\"\n    (AS DEFINED BELOW) BETWEEN YOU AND SNEI, SONY COMPUTER\n    ENTERTAINMENT INC., SONY COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT AMERICA LLC,\n    THEIR AFFILIATES, PARENTS OR SUBSIDIARIES (COLLECTIVELY, \"SONY\n    ENTITIES\"). YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE BINDING\n    ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISIONS AS DESCRIBED IN\n    SECTION 17. \n\nSection 17:\n\n    17. BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION\n\n    Purpose. The term \"Dispute\" means any dispute, claim, or\n    controversy between you and any Sony Entity regarding any SEN\n    First Party Services or the use of any devices sold by a Sony\n    Entity to access SEN First Party Services, whether based in\n    contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but\n    not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent\n    inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable\n    theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of\n    this Section 17 (with the exception of the enforceability of\n    the Class Action Waiver clause below). \"Dispute\" is to be\n    given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. If\n    you have a Dispute with any Sony Entity or any of a Sony\n    Entity's officers, directors, employees and agents that cannot\n    be resolved through negotiation within the time frame\n    described in the \"Notice of Dispute\" clause below. Other than\n    those matters listed in the Exclusions from Arbitration\n    clause, you and the Sony Entity that you have a Dispute with\n    agree to seek resolution of the Dispute only through\n    arbitration of that Dispute in accordance with the terms of\n    this Section 17, and not litigate any Dispute in court.\n    Arbitration means that the Dispute will be resolved by a\n    neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury.\n\n    Exclusions from Arbitration. YOU AND THE SONY ENTITIES AGREE\n    THAT ANY CLAIM FILED BY YOU OR BY A SONY ENTITY IN SMALL\n    CLAIMS COURT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION TERMS\n    CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 17.\n\n    RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION\n    WAIVER WITHIN 30 DAYS. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE\n    BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN THIS SECTION\n    17, YOU MUST NOTIFY SNEI IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE\n    THAT YOU ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT UNLESS A LONGER PERIOD IS\n    REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW. YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION MUST BE\n    MAILED TO 6080 CENTER DRIVE, 10TH FLOOR, LOS ANGELES, CA\n    90045, ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT/ARBITRATION AND MUST INCLUDE:\n    (1) YOUR NAME, (2) YOUR ADDRESS, (3) YOUR SEN FIRST PARTY\n    SERVICES ONLINE ID, IF YOU HAVE ONE, AND (4) A CLEAR STATEMENT\n    THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH ANY SONY ENTITY\n    THROUGH ARBITRATION.\n\n    Notice of Dispute. IF YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH ANY SONY ENTITY,\n    YOU MUST SEND WRITTEN NOTICE TO 6080 CENTER DRIVE, 10TH FLOOR,\n    LOS ANGELES, CA 90045, ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT/ARBITRATION,\n    ATTN: SONY LEGAL DEPARTMENT: DISPUTE RESOLUTION\" TO GIVE SNEI\n    OR THE SONY ENTITY YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO\n    RESOLVE THE DISPUTE INFORMALLY THROUGH NEGOTIATION. You agree\n    to negotiate resolution of the Dispute in good faith for no\n    less than 60 days after you provide notice of the Dispute. If\n    the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with does not resolve your\n    Dispute within 60 days from receipt of notice of the Dispute,\n    you or the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with may pursue your\n    claim in arbitration pursuant to the terms in this Section 17.\n\n    Class Action Waiver. ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS,\n    WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN\n    INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION\n    OR AS A NAMED OR UNNAMED MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED,\n    REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, UNLESS BOTH\n    YOU AND THE SONY ENTITY WITH WHICH YOU HAVE A DISPUTE\n    SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO DO SO IN WRITING FOLLOWING INITIATION OF\n    THE ARBITRATION. THIS PROVISION DOES NOT PRECLUDE YOUR\n    PARTICIPATION AS A MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION FILED ON OR BEFORE\n    AUGUST 20, 2011. THIS PROVISION IS NOT APPLICABLE TO THE\n    EXTENT SUCH WAIVER IS PROHIBITED BY LAW.\n\n    Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator.\n    If you or the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with elect to\n    resolve your Dispute through arbitration, the party initiating\n    the arbitration proceeding may initiate it with the American\n    Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), www.adr.org, or JAMS\n    www.jamsadr.com. The terms of this Section 17 govern in the\n    event they conflict with the rules of the arbitration\n    organization selected by the parties.\n\n    Arbitration Procedures. Because the software and/or service\n    provided to you by the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with\n    concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act\n    (\"FAA\") governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However,\n    applicable federal or state law may also apply to the\n    substance of any Disputes. For claims of less than $75,000,\n    the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related\n    Disputes (\"Supplementary Procedures\") shall apply including\n    the schedule of arbitration fees set forth in Section C-8 of\n    the Supplementary Procedures; for claims over $75,000, the\n    AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules and relevant fee schedules\n    for non-class action proceedings shall apply. The AAA rules\n    are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\n    Further, if your claims do not exceed $75,000 and you provided\n    notice to and negotiated in good faith with the Sony Entity\n    you had a Dispute with as described above, if the arbitrator\n    finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration,\n    you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and\n    costs as determined by the arbitrator, in addition to any\n    rights to recover the same under controlling state or federal\n    law afforded to the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with or\n    you. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need\n    not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a\n    party. Such award will be binding and final, excerpt for any\n    right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any\n    court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of\n    enforcement.\n\n    Location of Arbitration. You or the Sony Entity you have a\n    Dispute with may initiate arbitration in either San Mateo\n    County, California or the United States county in which you\n    reside. In the event that you select the county of your United\n    States residence, the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with may\n    transfer the arbitration to San Mateo, County in the event\n    that it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur\n    as a result of the change in location as determined by the\n    arbitrator.\n\n    Severability. If any clause within this Section 17 (other than\n    the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal\n    or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this\n    Section 17, and the remainder of this Section 17 will be given\n    full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is\n    found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Section 17\n    will be unenforceable, and the Dispute will be decided by a\n    court and you and the Sony Entity you have a dispute with each\n    agree to waive in that instance, to the fullest extent allowed\n    by law, any trial by jury.\n\n    Continuation. This Section 17 shall survive any termination of\n    this Agreement or the provision of SEN First Party Services to\n    you.\n\n-- \nHugo Roy, Project Lead\nTerms of Service; Didn't Read | www.tosdr.org\n\n-- \ntosdr.org | twitter.com/tosdr | github.com/tosdr\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n",
