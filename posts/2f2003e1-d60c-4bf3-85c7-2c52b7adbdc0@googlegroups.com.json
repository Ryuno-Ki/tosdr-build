You may reject any change \n>    Microsoft makes to Section 26.1 (other than address changes) by sending us \n>    notice within 30 days of the change by U.S. Mail to the address in Section \n>    26.1.1. If you do, the most recent version of Section 26.1 before the \n>    change you rejected will apply. \n>    8. Severability. If the class action waiver in Section 26.1.4 is found \n>    to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then \n>    Section 26.1 will not apply to those parts. Instead, those parts will be \n>    severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding \n>    in arbitration. If any other provision of Section 26.1 is found to be \n>    illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed with the remainder \n>    of Section 26.1 remaining in full force and effect. \n>\n>  \n>\n> From <\n> http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msca/en_CA/DisplayTermsOfUseAndSalePage/ThemeID.27659600/\n> > \n>\n\n-- \ntosdr.org | twitter.com/tosdr | github.com/tosdr\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n",
