[https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-2013?support_whyb=1]\n\nWhen you use the Internet, companies ask you to trust them with your private data: from personal messages, to search terms, to photos, and much more. But government officials increasingly ask companies to hand that data over, a fact highlighted by the recent battle over CISPA.\n\nTo make \"Who Has Your Back?\", EFF lawyers and activists review company policies and interview legal departments to find out exactly how companies deal with government requests for your data. We review their answers and give stars to companies with industry-leading policies and practices, which helps privacy-conscious users make informed decisions and encourages the companies to step it up.\n\nBut the real power behind \"Who Has Your Back?\" comes from you. EFF's strong and principled community pushes companies to take privacy seriously, and after three years, we're proud to report that even more companies have moved towards instituting best practices when it comes to standing up for users’ privacy from the government.\n\nWe’re proud to be fighting for users’ rights, made possible by donations from individuals like you. Please consider supporting projects like \"Who Has Your Back?\" by joining EFF today! [https://supporters/eff.org/donate/who-has-your-back]\n\nThank you,\n\nMarcia Hoffman\nEFF Senior Staff Attorney\nElectronic Frontier Foundation, 815 Eddy Street, San Francisco, CA 94109 USA\n\nEFF appreciates your support and respects your privacy: https://www.eff.org/policy\n\nUnsubscribe from future mailings or change your email preferences: https://supporters.eff.org/civicrm/profile/edit?reset=1&gid=18&id=512789&cs=1262c1a34a5d0187f860116c08295849_1367352628_168\n-- \nHugo Roy\n\nsent from my mobile, with free software: www.freeyourandroid.org. please excuse my brevity.\n\nTel. +336 08 741 341\n\n-- \ntosdr.org | twitter.com/tosdr | github.com/tosdr\n--- \nYou received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n",
