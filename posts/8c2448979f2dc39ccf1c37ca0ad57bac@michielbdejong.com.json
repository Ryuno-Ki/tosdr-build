You also use geolocation for other things like maps, gps, foursquare,\netcetera. Suggesting that if you don't want Amazon to trace your movements you should switch off your phone's geolocation\naltogether is an insulting way to answer a reasonable concern. It suggests that a way to opt out exists, whereas the elephant\nin the room there is that in reality this option is only a theoretical one for the vast majority of smartphone users.\n\nThey should just own up and say \"you get the app, we get your data. That's the deal we offer you, take it or leave it.\"\n\nThey should either make it opt-in (\"would you like this app to submit your uniquely identifiable location data to Amazon?\"),\nor opt-out (with a setting inside the app), or honestly tell us that providing such privacy options to their users is not\nconsidered a priority by their stockholders. Linking to screenshots of the device-wide settings is insulting.\n\n-- \nwww.tos-dr.info // www.twitter.com/tosdr // www.github.com/didnotread\n--- You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google Groups \"Terms of Service; Didn't Read\" group.\nTo unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send an email to tosdr+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com.\nTo post to this group, send email to tosdr@googlegroups.com.\nVisit this group at http://groups.google.com/group/tosdr?hl=en.\nFor more options, visit https://groups.google.com/groups/opt_out.\n\n\n",
