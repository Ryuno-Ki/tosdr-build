Cool site and service!  Would love to contribute.  Here's a quickie on Meet=
up.com, a site for facilitating real-world gatherings of people with common=
 interests ("using the Internet to get off the Internet").

TOPIC: Notice of Changing Terms

The top of Meetup's TOS isn't great, but it's a fairly typical we-may-chang=
e-at-any-time-check-our-website statement.  There's no notification; it is =
the user's responsibility to look at the most recent revision "frequently."=
=20

What I was surprised by is down below in Fees & Payments.  They reserve the=
 right to start charging for use of the website at any time.  They also res=
erve the right to change features/services and their fees at any time.  And=
, once they notify you (not specified how), you must pay and Meetup doesn't=
 care about your expenses, overdrawn accounts, etc.  They don't specify wha=
t would happen to your account info if you choose not to pay.  They don't s=
pecify how they will notify you - just one email that might end up in a spa=
m or Gmail Promotions folder?  The only saving grace here is that free user=
s of Meetup don't provide payment info (at least, not as of last year, when=
 I signed up for my account).  So I guess this mean-sounding policy doesn't=
 have teeth vis-a-vis free users.  Which means it doesn't play out practica=
lly in addition to sounding unfriendly.=20


Here's the text (at http://www.meetup.com/terms/)

3. Fees and Payments
3.1 General. Access to our websites and use of selected features of our Pla=
tform is free. We may charge fees for various premium features and services=
 that we offer, and we will notify you of those charges at the time that we=
 offer you the premium features or services for a fee. We may, in our sole =
discretion, and by notifying you on our website, change this policy and beg=
in charging for access to our website and other features and services, and =
we may, in our sole discretion, add, remove or change the features and serv=
ices we offer or the fees (including the amount or the type of fees) we cha=
rge at any time. If we introduce a new service or charge a new fee, we will=
 establish and notify you of the fees for that service at the launch of the=
 service or start of charging a new fee. If we notify you of new fees or ch=
ange the fees for an existing service, you agree to pay all fees and charge=
s specified and all applicable taxes for your continued use of the applicab=
le service. We are not responsible for any charges or expenses you incur re=
sulting from being billed by us in accordance with these Terms of Service (=
e.g., overdrawn accounts, exceeding account limits, etc.).=20
