4 weeks to review changes, possibility to negotiate and keep the
previous terms and/or prices

When we change terms or prices, we will notify you by email to your
main account in this Service. After receiving that email you have 30
days to respond (a) by informing us that you agree to the new terms or
prices, (b) by informing us that you disagree, in which case Kolab
Systems AG may on a case to case basis agree to continue providing you
with the Service under the previous terms and/or prices, or (c) by
giving us notice that you terminate this agreement regardless of the
remaining duration you had agreed to under the previous
terms. Continuation of use after 30 days will constitute agreement to
the new terms.
