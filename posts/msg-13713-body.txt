Foursquare has removed a paragraph detailing how to check-in privately, and
that although this info won't be made available to your friends (i.e., they
won't know, but you will still be checked-in anonymously), Foursquare can
still share this information in an anonymous fashion.

This seems like an important paragraph to remove. Without it, there's no
information on how to check-in privately.

*****

Skype changed some formatting, and "voicemail" to "voice messages," neither
of which I think are important changes to mention.
