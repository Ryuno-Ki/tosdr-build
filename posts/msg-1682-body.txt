We haven't got time to finish the analysis from WhatsApp. But you
might be interested in knowing that the app was found to be
violating privacy laws.

    WhatsApp=92s violation of privacy law partly resolved after
    investigation by data protection authorities
    Canadian and Dutch data privacy guardians release findings
    from investigation of popular mobile app

    Ottawa, Canada and The Hague, The Netherlands, January 28,
    2013 =97The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC)
    and the Dutch Data Protection Authority (College bescherming
    persoonsgegevens, (CBP)) today released their findings from a
    collaborative investigation into the handling of personal
    information by WhatsApp Inc., a California-based mobile app
    developer.

    The coordinated investigation is a global first, as two
    national data protection authorities conducted their work
    together to examine the privacy practices of a company with
    hundreds of millions of customers worldwide. This marks a
    milestone in global privacy protection. =20
