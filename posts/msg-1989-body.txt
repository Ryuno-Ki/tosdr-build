Special offers and community access to customer service may use different 
agreements than the EULA. However, these agreements cannot contradict the 
EULA.

Please note, however, that other aspects of your use of the Spotify Service 
> may be governed by additional agreements. That could include, for example, 
> access to the Spotify Community for customer support, access to the Spotify 
> Service as a result of a gift card, or free or discounted Trials. You will 
> agree to separate terms and conditions in those circumstances, which are 
> listed in full here <https://www.spotify.com/us/legal/links/>. Those 
> terms and conditions shall govern only with regard to the aspect of the 
> Service to which they apply, and are distinct from and supplemental to 
> these Agreements, and do not supersede these Agreements. To the extent that 
> there is any conflict between those agreements and these Agreements, these 
> Agreements shall control, except as otherwise provided in these Terms.
