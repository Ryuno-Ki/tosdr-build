I agree that making the data "anonymous" is most of the time not
enough for that data to stop being able to trace back to a user.
But we're still trying to find that information. I have done a lot
of navigation on Google's website right now. I have found nothing
at all on time limits to logs.

So I created a new point -(will appear on the website later, it's
in a working branch right now) that reads:


 -  Google keeps your searches and other identifiable user
    information for an undefined period of time

    Google collects a lot of information about the services you
    use and how you use them, including when you visit a website
    using a Google service for advertisement. In the past, Google
    stated in their Privacy Policy: *=93We strike a reasonable
    balance between the competing pressures we face, such as the
    privacy of our users, the security of our systems and the need
    for innovation. We believe anonymizing IP addresses after 9
    months and cookies in our search engine logs after 18 months
    strikes the right balance=94.* Today, these limitations of time
    are gone, or we haven't been able to find them. So we must
    conclude that Google has decided to stop trying to find the
    right balance between privacy of users and their own needs.

What do you think?
