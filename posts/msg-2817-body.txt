Currently, this is summarised like this:


   - *+* Spotify warns of third party uses Discussion<https://groups.google.com/d/topic/tosdr/U7B3ap8wM4s/discussion>
   
   Spotify takes precautions to prohibit third party applications from 
   attempting to identify you using information Spotify provides them. They 
   also inform you of the possible consequences should you allow this access.
   
Good. 30.

I think we shold improve this summary to reflect the clause and precautions 
taken by Spotify. Especially, "we take precautions to prohibit Third Party 
Application providers from attempting to identify you" might reward a 
better score (not sure about that).
