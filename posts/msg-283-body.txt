should compare this to what other services do, but at first sight it 
seems ok to me. it's good that it's nonexclusive, and in the next 
sentence they say they may use your display name in connection to it, so 
it seems they are really just saying they may reproduce the reviews you 
post.

not sure if this royalty-free license would allow them to sell any 
information you submit into your account to third parties, it seems to 
be mostly about reviews.
