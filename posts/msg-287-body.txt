"The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration 
Association (AAA) under its rules"
https://github.com/tosdr/tosback2/blob/265e49bf24a91076495ce1fddf279c4638421a66/crawl/amazon.com/Conditions%20of%20Use.txt#L176

Assuming the AAA is a fair organization, this seems reasonable, 
especially if you think about disputes as merchant-consumer disputes 
over the goods delivered in a specific sale. But then they continue:

"We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be 
conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated 
or representative action."
https://github.com/tosdr/tosback2/blob/265e49bf24a91076495ce1fddf279c4638421a66/crawl/amazon.com/Conditions%20of%20Use.txt#L184

which sounds like the same class action waiver we saw in other 
services. they phrase it in a symmetric way, but it still seems 
equivalent to the other ones.
