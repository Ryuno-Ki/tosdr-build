"we may receive information about your location and your mobile device, 
including a unique identifier for your device"
https://github.com/tosdr/tosback2/blob/master/crawl/amazon.com/Amazon.com%20Privacy%20Notice.txt#L37

If you follow their advice, they show you how to turn of location 
services entirely on your smartphone.
They even provide screenshots of how to do this on an Android or 
iPhone, in the phone-wide settings:
http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_468496_turnofflbs?nodeId=200903520

For a Kindle, or if Amazon is the only app on your phone, it makes 
sense to turn off geolocation entirely.
But of course this is not realistic for a smartphone! You also use 
geolocation for other things like maps, gps, foursquare,
etcetera. Suggesting that if you don't want Amazon to trace your 
movements you should switch off your phone's geolocation
altogether is an insulting way to answer a reasonable concern. It 
suggests that a way to opt out exists, whereas the elephant
in the room there is that in reality this option is only a theoretical 
one for the vast majority of smartphone users.

They should just own up and say "you get the app, we get your data. 
That's the deal we offer you, take it or leave it."

They should either make it opt-in ("would you like this app to submit 
your uniquely identifiable location data to Amazon?"),
or opt-out (with a setting inside the app), or honestly tell us that 
providing such privacy options to their users is not
considered a priority by their stockholders. Linking to screenshots of 
the device-wide settings is insulting.
