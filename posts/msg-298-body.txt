this contrasts with several other services which say you must use your 
real name, etcetera. of course, if you're going to buy anything then 
they will always have your real identity through your creditcard number, 
so that makes this a bit easier for them to say, but it's still nice 
that they do, and more services should include phrases like this in 
their privacy policies.
