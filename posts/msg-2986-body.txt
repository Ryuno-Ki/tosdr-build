Just FYI: I'm in the middle of moving between cities, and my wifi isn't 
great. I'll go through each new rule to verify and add xpath as soon as I 
get a chance.

I saw that some of them have encoded apostrophes in the xpath (&apos;); I 
haven't tested that, but I assume they'll work. Maybe we should keep them 
one way or the other though for consistency later on.

Also, I think using an attribute on the html for xpath when possible (e.g. 
"//div[@id='content']") instead of the full path (e.g. 
"/html/body/center/div/div[2]") would be better preparation for future site 
changes.

Thanks for submitting these!

Jimm
