this passage is relevant though, and includes a commitment to informing 
users pro-actively about any substantial changes:
"Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the 
Conditions of Use will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of 
our notices and conditions, but you should check our Web site frequently 
to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy 
Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your 
account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never 
materially change our policies and practices to make them less 
protective of customer information collected in the past without the 
consent of affected customers."
