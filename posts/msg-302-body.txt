Amazon will fingerprint your browser "for fraud prevention and 
diagnostic purposes"
https://github.com/tosdr/tosback2/blob/master/crawl/amazon.com/Amazon.com%20Privacy%20Notice.txt#L198

i thought about this for a while, because i think it's not actually bad 
to do this for e.g. fraud prevention, but i think they should only do it 
when you log in.

if i view a product on Amazon, then i want to be treated as an 
anonymous web surfer, i don't want to be fingerprinted. but if i log in 
to buy it, then i think it's reasonable, and useful, that they try to 
see from what device and IP address i am logging into my account.

still, apparently they are already "eyeing" me even if i'm just 
visiting a public product page, and that's not very polite i think.
