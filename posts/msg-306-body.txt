what do people think of this?

THE SELF-REGULATORY PROGRAM FOR ONLINE BEHAVIORAL ADVERTISING
http://www.aboutads.info/

i found a link to it in the Amazon privacy policy. Apparently it gives 
you one place to opt-out from many cookie-setting advertisers. how does 
this relate to the Do-Not-Track header?

Cheers,
Michiel
