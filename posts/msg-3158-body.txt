We're not focused on US law more than any other law. You mentioned
safe-harbour which us US-law centric, so I just gave 2 examples
(but you addressed only one) framed under that law. But these
cases apply everywhere, and the law is different in Europe (the
e-commerce directive bears some resemblance with DMCA, but they
are very different).

That, indeed, belongs to a judge ultimately. But you do realise
that companies actually make such decisions all the time, when
dealing with take-down procedures.

Such take-down procedures, when not handled correctly by the
service provider, have a chilling effect on freedom of expression.
This is a fact, no matter what your opinion on what copyright law
should be is. A bit of research on YouTube is enough to find out
about this (for instance, TV companies sending take-down notices
on NASA footage for the Mars mission, while NASA footage is in the
public domain in the US, there are tons of other examples).

I clearly mentioned in my two examples that sometimes, take-down
notices should not be taken seriously by the service provider
because we can imagine two cases:

 - the use obviously falls under fair-use/or under a copyright
   exception in Europe. (You wrote above that "obvious" to one
   person might not seem obvious to another, that is correct but
   that means this is not obvious at all in the end). Some things
   *can* be obvious.
 - the take-down notice fails to show that the person really is a
   copyright holder (in Europe, if the take-down notice is not
   informative enough for the service provider, then it does not
   trigger any obligation of prompt take down for them).

This is for all these reasons that we should analyse closely what
are the policy set forth in the terms by providers like Dropbox,
in relation to take-down procedures, before we dismiss something
as "normal" or "okay".=20

As you agreed, there are things we should take into account:

> I agree that someone like Dropbox should advise the target of a takedown =
that there is a=20
> counter-notice available, and which law it falls under. =20

Dropbox provides a service to their consumers. Why shouldn't they
"take side" with them? Obviously, I don't mean by that that
Dropbox should take insane legal risks for their consumers. I'm
talking about taking reasonable measures to make sure that their
service is useful for their users, and that a user who is doing
something *licit* is not being let down by dropbox for no
reasonable reason.

> As for a rule that a user who suffers n number of undisputed take downs s=
hould be=20

Of course that's up to the host. That's exactly why we're reading
their terms of service: to find out of they have such a policy,
and whether it might be unfair for a user who isn't doing
something illicit.

This is out of scope of this discussion. But BTW there is mistake.
The US Constitution does not "require" Congress to enact
copyright. It is only a possibility left to Congress. The clause
is quite clear:

    [Congress shall *have the power] to promote* the Progress of
    Science and the useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to
    Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective
    Writings and Discoveries.=20

And the US Supreme Court has said (Fox v. Doyal, maybe something
more recent confirm this):

    The sole interest of the United States and the primary object
    in conferring the [copyright] monopoly lie in the general
    benefits derived by the public from the labors of authors.=20

The First Amendment, on the contrary, starts with=20

    =93Congress *shall make no law*=85=94

So it is quite clear that the writers of the US amendments meant
that copyright is a possibility left to the Congress, whereas
freedom of expression is a requirement.

Best,
Hugo
