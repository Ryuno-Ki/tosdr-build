isn't that a bit strange? from the context, in a list with things like 
saying the app may not work if you don't have internet connectivity, it 
rather stands out, i wonder why the felt the need to include this.

it is definitely strange that i would hand over all my sensitive 
financial data to a company that expressly warns that they may leave it 
in the wrong place, either accidentally or because they feel like it.
