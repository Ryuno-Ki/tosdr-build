I see I have run into a hornet's nest while trying to explain an exceedingl=
y odd=20
feature of US law.  Of course I was US-centric.  I am an American lawyer an=
d=20
would have no business commenting on the copyright laws of Europe, Asia or=
=20
Africa or their nations.

I am afraid I do not agree that some things are obvious.  Or rather I have=
=20
found some things that are supposedly obvious are not true. Examples: =20
*    The Sun rotates about the Earth, which itself is flat. =20
*    Darker skinned persons are inferior. =20
*    Women are prone to uncontrolled emotions, far more than men, leading t=
o=20
     the English word "hysterical" from the Greek word for womb.=20
*    The Earth came into being some 6000 year ago.=20
I could go on.

Whether a storage company takes things down on its on hook, and reserves=20
the right to, bears on its quality of TOS that this forum rates. =20

In no case under US law is such a company required to do a take-down just=
=20
because someone complains it is a copyright infringement.  But if it does a=
nd=20
there is a proper counter-notice then it is open to liability for damages i=
f it=20
fails to restore the material.  And there is exposure to liability if it do=
es not do=20
a takedown when it gets a proper notice of alleged infringement.

I cannot comment and do not on anything but US law.  And I have no comment=
=20
on storage hosts who take down things like NASA footage.  I commented=20
solely on the US DMCA, largely because it is hard to understand so people d=
o=20
not understand it.  That in turn is because its language is about as inscru=

as any statute I have read in almost 40 years as a lawyer.
