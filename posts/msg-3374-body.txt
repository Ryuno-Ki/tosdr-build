Title : Youtube may changes its terms or service without notice

Topic : Changing terms

Summary : Youtube reserves the right to changes its terms or service at any
time without giving you any notice, and you will be bound by the
modifications and revisions that might occur. Youtube suggests that it may
attempt to notify the major changes but there is absolutely no guarantee
about that.

Score : bad, 35
