Most of you have probably seen the email reply, but here's a copy/paste:

Hi!

Also, Jimm, I know you're in the process of moving, but can you (or
someone else) upload some more recent crawl data? -- the last one is
from May 6th, a week ago...


It stopped because Jesse's changes were pulled into the github repo, but 
not to the crawler server. (It's basically trying to push to a repo that's 
more than a commit ahead of it). I'll begin testing and adding xpath to the 
~50 or so new rules today or tomorrow (if starbucks doesn't kick me out; 
should take me around ~4 hours), but it would be nice to keep 
*untested/unfinished* rules separate from the working/tested to avoid this 
later on. 

It's probably still scraping, and after I merge the commits, I'll push them 
up.

I'm in favor of splitting it if that's needed, but I'm not so
git-skilled as to be able to do it myself. We should also divide off the
crawl and log directories from the rest of the code, at a minimum.

Michiel, can you do that?

i'd rather leave it to Jimm. we should also mention it on the tosback 
mailing list


I would rather focus on ToSBack3. TB2 was just a way to get a set of rules 
and working scraper for TB3, right?

It appears that some sites are blocking tosback2's crawler -- we might
> consider adding user-agent spoofing to deal with this.
>

A huge amount of time has already gone into dealing with problems like 
these. It's not even just the user-agent (although that's already been 
added: 
https://github.com/tosdr/tosback2/blob/master/rubycode/tosback.rb#L187 ) 
but it's also been SSL issues, network hiccups, and just general file 
handling (e.g. 
http://jimmstout.com/2012/adding-a-default-content-type-to-mechanize-agent/)! 
Not to mention the madness of dealing with all the different page encodings 
(ugh ugh ugh). In other words, I'm super happy that we have *this many* 
working :P. 

Anyway, I totally agree that we need to get them _all_ working, but it 
could be any number of unimaginable things, haha. But right now, all the 
other work isn't really being used, and I would rather focus on that. 

Thanks,

Jimm
