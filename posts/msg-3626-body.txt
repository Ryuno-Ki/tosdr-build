As an example, I just obsessed over not letting Delicious win and figured 
out why theirs was returning blank results...

https://delicious.com/privacy is the URL they link in the footer, but that 
page was actually loading content from 
https://delicious.com/html/privacy.html. I'm just going to change the URL 
in our rules, but it creates the possibility that we don't see the changes 
if they just update what they're loading on https://delicious.com/privacy. 

Oh, the complications! >_<
