When you subscribe to the Sony Network (the PlayStation network
and Sony's music and video network; similar to Netflix I guess),
you are bound to arbitration.

The terms have a warning at the beginning:

    http://www.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com/terms-of-service/

    NOTE: THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION
    AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISION IN SECTION 17 THAT AFFECTS
    YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO ANY "DISPUTE"
    (AS DEFINED BELOW) BETWEEN YOU AND SNEI, SONY COMPUTER
    ENTERTAINMENT INC., SONY COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT AMERICA LLC,
    THEIR AFFILIATES, PARENTS OR SUBSIDIARIES (COLLECTIVELY, "SONY
    ENTITIES"). YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE BINDING
    ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISIONS AS DESCRIBED IN
    SECTION 17. 

Section 17:

    17. BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION

    Purpose. The term "Dispute" means any dispute, claim, or
    controversy between you and any Sony Entity regarding any SEN
    First Party Services or the use of any devices sold by a Sony
    Entity to access SEN First Party Services, whether based in
    contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but
    not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent
    inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable
    theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of
    this Section 17 (with the exception of the enforceability of
    the Class Action Waiver clause below). "Dispute" is to be
    given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. If
    you have a Dispute with any Sony Entity or any of a Sony
    Entity's officers, directors, employees and agents that cannot
    be resolved through negotiation within the time frame
    described in the "Notice of Dispute" clause below. Other than
    those matters listed in the Exclusions from Arbitration
    clause, you and the Sony Entity that you have a Dispute with
    agree to seek resolution of the Dispute only through
    arbitration of that Dispute in accordance with the terms of
    this Section 17, and not litigate any Dispute in court.
    Arbitration means that the Dispute will be resolved by a
    neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury.

    Exclusions from Arbitration. YOU AND THE SONY ENTITIES AGREE
    THAT ANY CLAIM FILED BY YOU OR BY A SONY ENTITY IN SMALL
    CLAIMS COURT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION TERMS
    CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 17.

    RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION
    WAIVER WITHIN 30 DAYS. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE
    BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN THIS SECTION
    17, YOU MUST NOTIFY SNEI IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE
    THAT YOU ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT UNLESS A LONGER PERIOD IS
    REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW. YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION MUST BE
    MAILED TO 6080 CENTER DRIVE, 10TH FLOOR, LOS ANGELES, CA
    90045, ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT/ARBITRATION AND MUST INCLUDE:
    (1) YOUR NAME, (2) YOUR ADDRESS, (3) YOUR SEN FIRST PARTY
    SERVICES ONLINE ID, IF YOU HAVE ONE, AND (4) A CLEAR STATEMENT
    THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH ANY SONY ENTITY
    THROUGH ARBITRATION.

    Notice of Dispute. IF YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH ANY SONY ENTITY,
    YOU MUST SEND WRITTEN NOTICE TO 6080 CENTER DRIVE, 10TH FLOOR,
    LOS ANGELES, CA 90045, ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT/ARBITRATION,
    ATTN: SONY LEGAL DEPARTMENT: DISPUTE RESOLUTION" TO GIVE SNEI
    OR THE SONY ENTITY YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO
    RESOLVE THE DISPUTE INFORMALLY THROUGH NEGOTIATION. You agree
    to negotiate resolution of the Dispute in good faith for no
    less than 60 days after you provide notice of the Dispute. If
    the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with does not resolve your
    Dispute within 60 days from receipt of notice of the Dispute,
    you or the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with may pursue your
    claim in arbitration pursuant to the terms in this Section 17.

    Class Action Waiver. ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS,
    WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN
    INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION
    OR AS A NAMED OR UNNAMED MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED,
    REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, UNLESS BOTH
    YOU AND THE SONY ENTITY WITH WHICH YOU HAVE A DISPUTE
    SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO DO SO IN WRITING FOLLOWING INITIATION OF
    THE ARBITRATION. THIS PROVISION DOES NOT PRECLUDE YOUR
    PARTICIPATION AS A MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION FILED ON OR BEFORE
    AUGUST 20, 2011. THIS PROVISION IS NOT APPLICABLE TO THE
    EXTENT SUCH WAIVER IS PROHIBITED BY LAW.

    Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator.
    If you or the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with elect to
    resolve your Dispute through arbitration, the party initiating
    the arbitration proceeding may initiate it with the American
    Arbitration Association ("AAA"), www.adr.org, or JAMS
    www.jamsadr.com. The terms of this Section 17 govern in the
    event they conflict with the rules of the arbitration
    organization selected by the parties.

    Arbitration Procedures. Because the software and/or service
    provided to you by the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with
    concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act
    ("FAA") governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However,
    applicable federal or state law may also apply to the
    substance of any Disputes. For claims of less than $75,000,
    the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related
    Disputes ("Supplementary Procedures") shall apply including
    the schedule of arbitration fees set forth in Section C-8 of
    the Supplementary Procedures; for claims over $75,000, the
    AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules and relevant fee schedules
    for non-class action proceedings shall apply. The AAA rules
    are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
    Further, if your claims do not exceed $75,000 and you provided
    notice to and negotiated in good faith with the Sony Entity
    you had a Dispute with as described above, if the arbitrator
    finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration,
    you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and
    costs as determined by the arbitrator, in addition to any
    rights to recover the same under controlling state or federal
    law afforded to the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with or
    you. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need
    not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a
    party. Such award will be binding and final, excerpt for any
    right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any
    court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of
    enforcement.

    Location of Arbitration. You or the Sony Entity you have a
    Dispute with may initiate arbitration in either San Mateo
    County, California or the United States county in which you
    reside. In the event that you select the county of your United
    States residence, the Sony Entity you have a Dispute with may
    transfer the arbitration to San Mateo, County in the event
    that it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur
    as a result of the change in location as determined by the
    arbitrator.

    Severability. If any clause within this Section 17 (other than
    the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal
    or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this
    Section 17, and the remainder of this Section 17 will be given
    full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is
    found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Section 17
    will be unenforceable, and the Dispute will be decided by a
    court and you and the Sony Entity you have a dispute with each
    agree to waive in that instance, to the fullest extent allowed
    by law, any trial by jury.

    Continuation. This Section 17 shall survive any termination of
    this Agreement or the provision of SEN First Party Services to
    you.
