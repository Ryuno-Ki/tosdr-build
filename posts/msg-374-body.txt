Does this mean you cannot ever use the law against them to claim your 
rights?
"WE [...] ARE NOT LIABLE [...] TO YOU [...] FOR ANY [...] DAMAGE, LOSS, 
COST OR EXPENSE [...] WHICH YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD"
https://github.com/tosdr/tosback2/blob/265e49bf24a91076495ce1fddf279c4638421a66/crawl/mega.co.nz/Terms%20of%20Service.txt#L290

now compare that to the corresponding companion clause that acts in the 
opposite direction:
"YOU SHALL INDEMNIFY US AGAINST ALL [...] EXPENSES, [...] DAMAGES AND 
LOSSES [...] ARISING [...] FROM BREACH BY YOU OR ANYONE YOU GIVE ACCESS 
TO YOUR DATA, OF ANY OF THESE TERMS"
https://github.com/tosdr/tosback2/blob/265e49bf24a91076495ce1fddf279c4638421a66/crawl/mega.co.nz/Terms%20of%20Service.txt#L294

ok, so you don't always have to pay them, only if you *or* somebody you 
share a link with, breaches the terms.
otoh, they are never liable to you, even if they break the terms.

So that's totally asymmetrical and unfair between the two parties in 
this contract, i would say.
