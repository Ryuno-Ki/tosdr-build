I'm looking at the ToS for a bunch of Quantified-Self-related services 
(incl. BodyMedia, Fitbit, Withings, Runkeeper etc) while I'm drafting the 
terms for my own service (Zenobase).

I'd like to share my findings, and was wondering if contributing to ToS;DR 
might be better than just doing a blog post somewhere.

However, ToS:DR does not currently make it easy for people to compare terms 
across similar sites (be it "social networking" or "quantified self"), and 
I wonder how many years it would take for all the submitted information to 
appear on http://tosdr.org (slow review process, and IANAL).

What do you think?
