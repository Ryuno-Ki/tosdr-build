Hello Eric,

That would be great :) of course, you can also do both.

We are working on redesigning things a bit so that the "search"
feature is more obvious. If you go to tosdr.org and perform a
search (by a service's name or by a keyword, like "social") you
should get a comparison of services. Also, we link services
between each other, so if you search "Google" for instance you
will also get "related" services like DuckDuckGo or Yahoo!.

Right now the search feature is a bit alpha, it needs work. But it
should not be difficult for users to compare.

Also, we have http://tosdr.org/topics.html where you compare by
topics rather than by service; which can also be useful.

The project isn't a year old yet :) We are dealing with some
backlog, but it's not taking that long. Also, we are building
tools to make it easier for more people to work on the process of
getting the data to a structured format, ready for
http://tosdr.org

Which all reminds me that I need to do a better version for the
"how to contribute" page. :)

Thank you,
Hugo
