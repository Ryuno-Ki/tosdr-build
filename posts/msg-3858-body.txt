I can't really answer that effectively, because I don't know anything about 
Canadian law (I'm a California attorney). However, a quick search indicates 
that Canada is probably going the same direction as the US, after *Murphy v 
Amway Canada Corp*. *Murphy* holds that unless there is express statutory 
language prohibiting arbitration agreements or class action waivers, courts 
will hold parties to their agreements to arbitrate and waive class 
actions. Again, that's a Google answer, not a legal answer; I don't know 
Canadian law.

Regardless, the governing law for most of the terms of service we're 
talking about is within the United States -- it's California for the Sony 
Entertainment Network terms of service.
