Quotation from the site if you are interested
We use the information we receive about you in connection with the services
and features we provide to you and other users like your friends, our
partners, the advertisers that purchase ads on the site, and the developers
that build the games, applications, and websites you use. For example, in
addition to helping people see and find things that you do and share, we
may use the information we receive about you:

   - as part of our efforts to keep Facebook products, services and
   integrations safe and secure;
   - to protect Facebook's or others' rights or property;
   - to provide you with location features and services, like telling you
   and your friends when something is going on nearby;
   - to measure or understand the effectiveness of ads you and others see,
   including to deliver relevant ads to you;
   - to make suggestions to you and other users on Facebook, such as:
   suggesting that your friend use our contact importer because you found
   friends using it, suggesting that another user add you as a friend because
   the user imported the same email address as you did, or suggesting that
   your friend tag you in a picture they have uploaded with you in it; and
   - for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis,
   testing, research and service improvement.
