Thanks. That's already good to know.

Yes, that wasn't the point of my question. I'm more trying to find
some other examples to have a good metric whether we decide to
rate this as "bad" or neutral. For instance, the fact that courts
around the world qualify something as "illegal" usually encourage
us to think that if a ToS provides it, it's usually bad, even if
it's legal in their jurisdiction (for instance, the moral rights
waivers aren't illegal in the US; but they're illegal in a lot of
other countries and when you have a look at what a moral right
waiver is, then it's easy to put it in the "bad" category for
ToS;DR).

Putting the law aside, what is your opinion Hannah about these
class-action waivers and these arbitration clauses? How do you
feel about them, are they just a minor inconvenience or are they
really unfair?
