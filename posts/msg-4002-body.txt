Ah -- I see where you're coming from. That's a good point, and it would be 
interesting to see how other countries approach this particular point.

That's a hard thing to answer. My practice involves writing a lot of terms 
of use, so obviously, I like things that provide my clients the most 
protection possible. 

However (and please forgive me, I'm about to get very preachy...) speaking 
strictly for myself, I strongly dislike them in the context of standard 
terms of service and end user license agreements. On the one hand, I 
understand why the Supreme Court made the decision it did: in a 
well-negotiated contract, where two parties have, for reasonable 
consideration, agreed that they will waive the right to class action and 
agreed that they will settle disputes through alternative dispute 
resolution rather than going to court, the parties should be held to that 
agreement. However, terms of use and EULAs are not well-negotiated 
contracts. They are not negotiated contracts at all, and this fact changes 
everything.

Terms of use and EULAs are contracts of adhesion: non-negotiable contracts 
in which one party has all the bargaining power and the other party can 
only take or leave the the terms. Given the doctrine of unconscionability 
(unconscionability has two factors: procedural and substantive 
unconscionability, and both have to be satisfied before a contract can be 
found unconscionable), I believe that terms of service are, at the outset, *
barely* fair. They start out being procedurally unconscionable. It is the 
job of the person writing the terms of use to make sure they aren't also 
substantively unconscionable, because if they are, the entire agreement 
could fail.

This is why I really get upset at class action waivers and poorly drafted, 
consumer-unfriendly arbitration clauses (as well as other majorly faulty 
terms of use elements). It's my job to write terms of use that protect my 
clients, of course. But it doesn't protect my client if I write an 
agreement that is *so* horribly weighted in their favor that it actually 
harms their customers to do business with them. It benefits no one if the 
terms of a contract are so unfairly advantageous to one side that a court 
must invalidate the agreement.

To sum up, because I did get wordy: I absolutely think there is a 
justifiable reason for class action waivers and arbitration requirements in 
negotiated contracts. But in contracts of adhesion, like terms of use 
agreements, I think they run the risk of making the entire agreement 
unconscionable. 

(P.S., this is not meant to be legal advice, etc. It's meant to be common 
sense. If you write an unfair agreement, it's probably unfair, even if 
you're technically allowed to do it. The end.)
