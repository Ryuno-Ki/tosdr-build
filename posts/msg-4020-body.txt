This looks bad to me as well. I'm wondering why users would be "powerless"=
=20
against them in court. Because Amazon can afford the best lawyers? I think=
=20
that's true, but also does a diservice to the legal system we have (at=20
least in the US). A good argument is a good argument, regardless of your=20
retainer fees. Arbitration, and waiving your rights to a jury trial=20
especially, really scares me. The class action waiver is also clearly to=20
protect Amazon in the event that they have committed some wrong to a large=
=20
number of people. I'm not sure how that's beneficial to a user in the least=
.

Based on the points made here, can we agree this a "bad" point for Amazon?=
=20
This is something we might offer for BBC Law in Action.
