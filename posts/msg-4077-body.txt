I agree. It seems a reasonable practice for registered users, but I don't 
like the idea that I'm fingerprinted even though I don't have an account. I 
looked at eBay to compare, since they are somewhat similar services, but 
they don't have anything like this in their terms, which I found a bit odd.

<br>i thought about this for a while, because i think it's not actually bad

<br>
<br>if i view a product on Amazon, then i want to be treated as an

<br>still, apparently they are already "eyeing" me even if i'm just
