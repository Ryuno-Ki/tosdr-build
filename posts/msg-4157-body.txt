Service: Skype
Privacy Policy: http://www.skype.com/en/legal/privacy/#protectionOfPersonalInformation

    8. HOW DOES SKYPE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

    Skype will take appropriate organizational and technical
    measures to protect the personal data and traffic data
    provided to it or collected by it with due observance of the
    applicable obligations and exceptions under the relevant
    legislation. Your personal and traffic data can only be
    accessed by authorized employees of Microsoft or its
    affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers who need to have
    access to this data in order to be able to fulfill their given
    duties.

    Skype may use automated scanning within Instant Messages and
    SMS to (a) identify suspected spam and/or (b) identify URLs
    that have been previously flagged as spam, fraud, or phishing
    links. In limited instances, Skype may capture and manually
    review instant messages or SMS in connection with Spam
    prevention efforts. Skype may, in its sole discretion, block
    or prevent delivery of suspected Spam, and remove suspicious
    links from messages.

So it must be clear to users of Skype that their private
conversations may be monitored my Skype.

See for instance: http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/think-your-skype-messages-get-end-to-end-encryption-think-again/
http://yro.slashdot.org/story/13/05/14/1516247/microsoft-reads-your-skype-chat-messages

How should we rate that?
