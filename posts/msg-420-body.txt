I agree, reverse-engineering typically leads to a different implementation 
that has the same outward behavior. Also, how detailed is this condition?

If I create a program that categorizes transactions in a way that resembles 
mint.com's scheme, is that illegal?

<br>it's fair enough that you may not crawl their site in an automated way, 
<br>but as i said in the Amazon data point about the same topic, just trying 
<br>to reverse-engineer the products you consume should not be considered a
