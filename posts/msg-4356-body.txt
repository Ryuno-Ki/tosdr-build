Hey Jesse,

The server is current with the updated rules now. I believe you mentioned 
that you don't have the environment set up for testing the rules, so I went 
through and verified them today. I still think it would be best to verify 
them before pulling them to the server.

I noticed that you had replaced one of the rules with a comment about the 
site going into maintenance. I added back the same url and xpath, so maybe 
it's not necessary to do that? 

Thanks for your updates,

Jimm
