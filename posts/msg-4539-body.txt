A point about the question of the legality of arbitration clauses and the
possibility that they can be considered as abusive.
From a comparative point of view, French law considers that, according to
the classification of 1978 about abusive clauses, the clauses that impose
arbitration are "presumably abusive" :
Article R-132-2 of consumption code, point 10 possibly translated this way
: "to suppress or to harm the exercise of legal action or recourses for the
consumer, namely by forcing him to choose exclusively a jurisdiction of
arbitration not covered by legal dispositions, or to pass exclusively by an
alternative mode of dispute resolution"

Also, according to the CEDH, everybody has the right to be defended in
front a jurisdiction that is not a jurisdiction of arbitration.

By the way, point 6 also considers as presumably abusive the fact that "a
professional is the only party that can modify the clauses of the contracts
that are related to obligations and the rights of the parties".
