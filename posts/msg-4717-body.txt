Thank you for your wonderful service!

Wondered what you thought of this...

https://jawbone.com/legal/privacy

1. While I believe Apple's iOS now prevents Apps from covertly "stealing" y=
our contact and calendar info, this statement is very concerning.

"When you use the Jawbone Companion app we connect with and upload to our s=
ervers the address book and calendar on your device along with other data t=
hat we normally collect through our mobile apps described in the app usage =
data section below."

2. I am concerned about the terms "information" vs "personal information". =
 Seems to me that all information they collect about the user is "personal"=
.  Their terms seem contradictory - they need your consent, but then they c=
an share (presumably without your consent) with pretty much anyone they wan=
t!

"We may share your personal information with your consent.

We may share your Information with third parties to provide services on our=
 behalf such as to process payments, or to store information collected thro=
ugh our site, app, and services.

We may share information with a parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture=
s, or other companies under common control with us.

We may share your personal information for the purposes of a business deal =
(or negotiation of a business deal) involving sale or transfer of all or a =
part of our business or assets. These deals can include any merger, financi=
ng, acquisition, or bankruptcy transaction or proceeding."

Please review.  Thanks.  Maybe our input/feedback will make them a bit more=
 transparent?

-Richard
