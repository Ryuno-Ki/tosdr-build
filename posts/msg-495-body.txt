there is no advantage for the reviewer; arguably sending an email is in=20
fact even a bit less work than going to our website and filling out a=20
form. But the advantage for the curator is considerable because it=20
automates the step from free-text email to JSON file.

which ones? The ssh step? if curators (currently mainly Ian) have a=20
problem with that or experience it as a bottleneck, then we can do a=20
download-and-paste step like you suggest.

sure, we can do the two in parallel, and whoever ends up doing the work=20
can then do whatever we end up deciding we need. you're right, it's a=20
good idea to have this discussion at least before someone starts working=20
on it, yes. :)

the advantages of your proposal are that there is no server needed, and=20
the curator does not have to use ssh. Those are both advantages for us,
the team. However, the disadvantage is that the reviewers have to log=20
in to github, both to create new points, and to discuss points that=20
other reviewers create.

At this point, once the reviewer has already filled out the whole form,=20
it is more friendly to just provide a 'submit' button. Making the=20
reviewer go to github just so that we don't have to implement a server=20
is too much price in terms of usability for too little gain on our side,=20
i think. You don't see generic web 2.0 websites do this either, showing=20
a user a "now please manually paste this JSON into our database"=20
message, for this same reason i think.

It would also require us to move the discussion to github. This was=20
proposed before, by Jan, when we thought many of the reviewers might be=20
github users, but we decided against that, and create the Google Group=20
instead. If we decide to move the discussion somewhere else, then we=20
should do that for functional reasons, not for technical ones. I think=20
maybe at some point we want to host the discussion on the website, so=20
that we can add more custom context to discussions, but for now, I think=20
having it at Google Groups is good enough?

Anyway, whether the JSON is saved to a file, or offered back for=20
copy-pasting, in both cases we need someone to create that html form, so=20
the request for someone to join the team and work on that still stands!=20
:)


Cheers,
Michiel
