Valve, Netflix, and YouTube have similar clauses, although none of those=20
services even hint at making an effort to inform users in advance, as=20
Dropbox does. Here's my proposal for this point:

Title: Dropbox can cancel your account without notice

Topic: Suspension and Censorship

Summary: We reserve the right to suspend or end the Services at any time,=
=20
with or without cause, and with or without notice. For example, we may=20
suspend or terminate your use if you are not complying with these Terms, or=
=20
use the Services in any way that would cause us legal liability or disrupt=
=20
others=92 use of the Services. If we suspend or terminate your use, we will=
=20
try to let you know in advance and help you retrieve data, though there may=
=20
be some cases (for example, repeatedly or flagrantly violating these Terms,=
=20
a court order, or danger to other users) where we may suspend immediately.

Score: 40 (mediocre)
