My thinking is that the average user is going to be more concerned about 
what happens to their photos, graphics, audio and/or video than about any 
comments they might make on a discussion board (not that that information 
isn't important to some users, but I feel like average users care more 
about the more obvious content, i.e., photos, etc.).

Here's what I would propose:

Title: Yahoo has a limited copyright license

Topic: Scope of the copyright license

Summary: For photos, graphics, audio or video that you make publicly 
available, the license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, 
publicly perform and publicly display such Content on the Yahoo! Services 
solely for the purpose for which such Content was submitted or 
made available. This license exists only for as long as you elect 
to continue to include such Content on the Yahoo! Services and will 
terminate at the time you remove or Yahoo! removes such Content from the 
Yahoo! Services. For any other content you submit, however, you grant 
Yahoo! an irrevocable, sublicensable license to use, distribute, repoduce, 
modify, or adapt as they choose.

Score: 50 (mediocre)
