This seems vague to me. Does this mean they aren't liable if they delete or 
fail to store your stuff? Or are they saying that is the user's 
responsibility? If it's the first case, then that's obviously incredibly 
terrible. If it's the second, that seems more reasonable. For what it's 
worth, this is under the heading "General practices regarding use and 
storage".
