So, since this idea that personal information is a business asset is=20
common, this particular point isn't relevant, as I understand it. What=20
would be relevant for people to know would be something like:

Title: Your data is a business asset

Topic: Personal Data

Summary: If Twitter is bought, goes into bankruptcy, is involved in a=20
merger or is reorganized, the transfer of your personal information may be=
=20
part of that process. This data includes your name, username, password,=20
email address, and your tweets, including photos.

Score: 20, mediocre

<br>they have a right to sell, transfer it. That happens in two situations:
