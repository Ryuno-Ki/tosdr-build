Personally, I think an email notice is a good practice for companies to get
into. I should have access to the English version. I'll sift through my
email to find the one they sent and give it a look.

Hello,<br>
<br>
I have received an email through PayPal warning me about modifications<br>
to their terms. I have accessed a very useful page, (a bit long) where<br>
they describe the page.<br>
<br>
The problem is that I have access to the French version. Does anybody<br>
have access to the English version?<br>

Thanks,<br>
