Good, relevant point that we should keep on the site.

<br>
<br>I have decided to give a look back at Twitter's practice regarding
<br>changing their ToS.
<br>
<br>Le mardi 19 juin 2012 =E0 18:22 +0200, Hugo Roy a =E9crit :
<br>&gt; I decided to put together the two issues: the fact that Twitter ca=
n

ving
<br>&gt; the user or anything (which is pretty standard and not very evil) =
;
<br>&gt; with the fact that Twitter did critical changes to the ToS in the =

<br>&gt; you have more context on this, but I haven't been able to find
<br>&gt; anything at the time, and no,i don't consider that this

s-new-terms-of-<wbr>service.html</a> is
<br>&gt; enough)
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; Do you think I went too far with the score?
<br>
<br>So, one thing is they don't organise user feedback like Facebook, and
<br>they don't give a minimum delay for users to review the changes (as
<br>Google, Facebook and Soundcloud do for instance).
<br>
<br>One of the problematic thing was the notification. As I said, there was
<br>a blogpost the very same day the terms got changed (so no delay at all)
<br>and an email:
<br>&gt; -- 1. except for an email, as they claim in the blogpost. But I ca=
n't
<br>&gt; find any email of the sort in September 2009.=20
<br>
<br>I have asked around on Twitter if anybody had received such email.
<br>Someone got it and forwarded it to me. The email is very, very light (n=
o
<br>information about the changes, just information that the terms have
<br>changed and a link to <a href=3D"http://blog.twitter.com" target=3D"_bl=
ank">blog.twitter.com</a>)
<br>
<br>The blog post is very light:
<br><a href=3D"http://blog.twitter.com/2009/09/twitters-new-terms-of-servic=
e.html" target=3D"_blank">http://blog.twitter.com/2009/<wbr>09/twitters-new=
-terms-of-<wbr>service.html</a> and
<br>the key sentence about the change in copyright licenses is synthesised
<br>as:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ownership=97Twitter is allowed to "use, cop=
y, reproduce, process,
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display a=
nd distribute" your
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; tweets because that's what we do. However, =
they are your tweets
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and they belong to you.
<br>
<br>Curiously enough, no mention that this includes also the right to
<br>sublicense, which to me is an important aspect.
<br>
<br>In order to reflect this I have changed slightly the point.
