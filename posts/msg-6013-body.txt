(good) Personal info disclosed to law enforcement by court order only. User

*As a general principle, the access to, and retention of, personally 
identifiable data in all projects should be minimal and should be used only 
internally to serve the well-being of the projects. Occasionally, however, 
the Foundation may receive a subpoena or other compulsory request from a 
law-enforcement agency or a court or equivalent government body that 
requests the disclosure of information about a registered user, and may be 
compelled by law to comply with the request. In the event of such a legally 
compulsory request, the Foundation will attempt to notify the affected user 
within three business days after the arrival of such subpoena by sending a 
notice by email to the email address (if any) that the affected user has 
listed in his or her user preferences.*
