So, maybe this point could be summarized as follows:

Title: Amazon requires claims be resolved via binding arbitration

Topic: Waiver

Summary: When you sign up for Amazon, you agree that any claim that might 
be brought by Amazon against you, or by you against Amazon, be resolved in 
binding arbitration rather than in court. Arbitrators can award, on an 
individual basis, the same damages and relief as a court. Amazon also 
states that no claims can be brought against them as part of a class, 
consolidated, or representative action. This means you waive your right to 
a class action suit. If the claim proceeds to court, you also waive your 
right to a jury trial.

Score: 50 (mediocre)

***for this particular score, I'm not sure sure what to write. On the 
website we have a range of 20 (mediocre) - 150 (alert), between the 
services of Netflix, Valve, Microsoft, and 500px. This seems more in line 
with Netflix and 500px to me.
