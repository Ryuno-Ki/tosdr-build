Personally, I'd call it worse than mediocre, because I really dislike class 
action waivers unless they're really necessary. I'm sure Amazon has many 
grounds to believe that class action waivers are really necessary, and 
that's understandable...but *because* of the presence of a class action 
waiver, I'd put an alert on it and invite consumers to make up their minds.

The arbitration provision is mediocre (and pretty mild).
