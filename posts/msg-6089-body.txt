This clause is comparable to other services we already have on the website 
(500px, Facebook) but if this is just about user reviews, since Amazon 
isn't the kind of sharing website like the others, I don't really see a 
point in mentioning this.

<br>Yes, I suppose this is for user reviews. I can't really see this
