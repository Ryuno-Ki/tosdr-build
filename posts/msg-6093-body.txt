Title: Amazon can terminate your account in its sole discretion

Topic: suspension

Summary: Amazon reserves the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, 
remove or edit content, or cancel orders in its sole discretion.

Score: 75 (mediocre) (I gave this a higher score than most of the others 
because there's no mention of notifying the user)
