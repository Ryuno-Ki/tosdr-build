<br>&gt; A few things that caught my eye -=20
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; Right off the bat - "If you visit or shop at Amazon.com, you accep=
t these conditions." &nbsp;This is something that is weak from a legal stan=
dpoint. &nbsp;Amazon does not require you to acknowledge terms when you vie=
w or visit the site. &nbsp;What would make this hold up is if there was a v=
ery visible notice or a acknowledgement indicating that you agreed. &nbsp;I=
t's like asking about a raffle and then being required to enter it simply b=
y asking about it. &nbsp;It's almost a nonsensical stipulation. &nbsp;This =
is exactly why legitimate parking lots have "we will tow you" signs posted =
at the entrance of their lots.
<br>&gt;=20
<br>
<br>I agree this kind of statement would have to go through a judge to
<br>test its validity. It is not that easy to make one bound by a
<br>contract (there was a decision by the French supreme court
<br>recently about this
<br><a href=3D"http://www.legalis.net/spip.php?page=3Djurisprudence-decisio=
n&amp;id_article=3D3534" target=3D"_blank">http://www.legalis.net/spip.<wbr=
>php?page=3Djurisprudence-<wbr>decision&amp;id_article=3D3534</a>)
<br>
<br>However, I don't feel we need to mention this. It's far from
<br>specific to Amazon. For instance, when you search Google, you are
<br>also bound to some terms even though you did not necessarily click
<br>"I accept" on their terms.
<br>
<br>&gt; As you read the rest of this - remember that you have already agre=
ed to this by virtue of visiting Amazon's website.
<br>&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<br>&gt; "you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur =
under your account or password. Amazon does sell products for children, but=
 it sells them to adults, who can purchase with a credit card or other perm=
itted payment method. If you are under 18, you may use Amazon.com only with=
 involvement of a parent or guardian." &nbsp;This is a somewhat contradicto=
ry clause. &nbsp;If your kid makes a purchase on Amazon (without your conse=
nt), he or she is entering into a contract with Amazon, which is immediatel=
y void because the contract is with a minor. Amazon is saying that you woul=
d be responsible, but that they cannot sell products to kids without their =
parents permission. &nbsp;Clear as mud?
<br>
<br>Thank you, there are indeed interesting bits there. To me the
<br>relevant part are:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;=20
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; If you use any Amazon Service, you are responsible for
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; maintaining the confidentiality of your account and passw=
ord
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; and for restricting access to your computer, and you agre=
e to
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; accept responsibility for all activities that occur under=
 your
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; account or password.=20
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; [=85]
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Amazon reserves the right to refuse service, terminate
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; accounts, remove or edit content, or cancel orders in its
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; sole discretion.
<br>
<br>While the first part starts with something reasonable (you are
<br>responsible for your own security) I think that to make the
<br>user "accept responsibility for all activities that occur under
<br>your account" might be a bit overbroad. What if the activity
<br>occurring under an account happens after Amazon made a mistake?
<br>
<br>As for Amazon reserving the right to remove content, cancel orders
<br>and terminate accounts; it seems a bit broad to me. We should
<br>review that more in-depth.
<br>
<br>&gt; "We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be con=
ducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or repr=
esentative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than =
in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial." &nbsp;That is, no =
one (not even a lawyer on your behalf) can bring a class action lawsuit aga=
inst Amazon. &nbsp;You must use an arbitrator - one selected by Amazon. &nb=
sp; &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Thanks, we're dealing with this clause in another discussion.
<br>
<br>&gt; I have a few more - including the use of any customer's name that =
may raise some eyebrows. &nbsp;
<br>&gt;=20
<br>&gt; However, overall nothing seems to be too out of line. &nbsp;But I =
suppose that's up to the reader.
