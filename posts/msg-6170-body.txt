I think this is a very important point, especially in light of Mr. Snowden 
and the NSA issues happening here in the US at present. Personally, I feel 
uneasy about a service having access to my private messages. In my use of 
Skype, I've never encountered any spam URLs or anything that they 
apparently would be scanning for, so I wonder how often that occurs. (Note: 
I'm aware that my usage of their service isn't necessarily reflective of 
the average interaction). Still, I would think it's a fairly negative 
point, a low alert, maybe.

Here's what I'd propose:

Title: Skype may monitor your private messages

Topic: track

Summary: Skype may use automated scanning within Instant Messages and SMS 
to (a) identify suspected spam and/or (b) identify URLs that have been 
previously flagged as spam, fraud, or phishing links. In limited instances, 
Skype may capture and manually review instant messages or SMS in connection 
with Spam prevention efforts. Skype may, in its sole discretion, block or 
prevent delivery of suspected Spam, and remove suspicious links from 
messages.

Score: 35 (alert)

<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 8. HOW DOES SKYPE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Skype will take appropriate organizational and technical
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; measures to protect the personal data and traffic data
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; provided to it or collected by it with due observance of =
the
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; applicable obligations and exceptions under the relevant
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; legislation. Your personal and traffic data can only be
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; accessed by authorized employees of Microsoft or its
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers who need to=
 have
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; access to this data in order to be able to fulfill their =
given
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; duties.
<br>
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Skype may use automated scanning within Instant Messages =
and
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; SMS to (a) identify suspected spam and/or (b) identify UR=
Ls
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; that have been previously flagged as spam, fraud, or phis=

ock
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; or prevent delivery of suspected Spam, and remove suspici=
ous
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; links from messages.
<br>
<br>So it must be clear to users of Skype that their private
<br>conversations may be monitored my Skype.
