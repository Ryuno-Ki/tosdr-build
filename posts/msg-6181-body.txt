I'm not able, right now, to find the thread where I went into detail about=
=20
class action waivers, but the important part of it is that the court case=
=20
that changed everything was *AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion* in 2011. Before=
=20
that, you didn't generally see class action waivers in terms of service,=20
because some states didn't allow them -- most notably, California had a law=
=20
specifically banning arbitration agreements with class action waivers. *AT&=
T=20
Mobility v. Concepcion* struck down the California test, and all of a=20
sudden we're seeing class action waivers in terms of service. ....Ever=20
since 2011. ...Which means that in 2009, when *this* suit was initiated=20
against Amazon, there weren't class action waivers in terms of service. See=
?

I agree: the difference between a license and a sale is an extremely=20
crucial one. It's one that I do think users should be fighting over. When=
=20
you buy a hard copy of a book, it is yours and you have the right to=20
dispose of it however you see fit, under the first sale doctrine. When you=
=20
buy a digital copy of a book, it is absurd that you only license it and=20
have no rights to it. But it's one that you'll find yourself flagging every=
=20
time you see a license agreement, and as with many things, the exact=20
wording of the license agreement matters so much.

I think your proposed write-up for this point is a good one. I suggest=20
linking to https://www.eff.org/issues/digital-books=20
and https://www.eff.org/issues/drm as well.
