This arbitration clause doesn't seem that bad to me because they state that=
=20
small claims court is also an option (but that if you go to arbitration,=20
you give up your rights to small claims or a class action suit).

Title: Skype has binding arbitration

Topic: governance

Summary: If you and Skype cannot settle a dispute via informal negotiation=
=20
or small claims court, you agree that any other effort to resolve the claim=
=20
will be settled by arbitration. This means you give up the right to=20
litigate and/or be part of any class action before a judge or jury.

Score:  20 (mediocre)
