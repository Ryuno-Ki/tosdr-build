I'm certain that most people are unaware of this. However, considering that 
their terms can change at any time without notice to the user, this clause 
seems to add insult to injury a little bit. So, I think that specifically 
because of that any-time-without-notification practice users need to be 
aware that they have some power here, if a bit cumbersome to use.

Title: You can reject changes to Skype's arbitration and class action terms

Topic: user-choice

Summary: If you don't like any changes Skype makes to the paragraph dealing 
with arbitration and class action, you can write to them and reject those 
changes, provided you do so within 30 days of the changes. This point seems 
a bit less effective when coupled with the fact that they can change their 
terms at any time without notifying users.

Score: 20 (good)
