I fail to see how such a broad copyright license is necessary to operate=20
the service. Surely it could be reduced in scope.

Title: Very broad copyright license

Topic: copyright-scope

Summary: You grant Skype a very broad copyright license to use any content=
=20
that you upload, without compensation. This license is a non-exclusive,=20
royalty-free, irrevocable, worldwide, perpetual, sub-licensable and=20
transferable license of the rights to use your content. This goes beyond=20
the scope necessary to operate the service itself.
