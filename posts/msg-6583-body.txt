there's at least one other service that issues it's own statute of=20

Title: Your legal recourse is limited

Topic: governance

Summary: Apple imposes a statute of limitations of one (1) year for any=20
claim(s) you might have against their services. In addition, the only=20
financial awards consist of money for attorney fees and court costs and=20
out-of-pocket expenses. If you're unable to resolve your dispute within 30=
=20
days, the dispute may be submitted to mediation. Only after mediation can=
=20
either party take the claim to court.

Score: 30 (mediocre)
