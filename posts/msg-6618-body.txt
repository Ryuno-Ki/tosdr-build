Hi, Jonathan,

Thought I'd dive in here to give a more thorough explanation of the 
13-and-under rule. 

Any website that operates in the US (this includes foreign-based sites that 
are accessible from the US) and collects any personally-identifying 
information from users under the age of 13 must comply with COPPA<http://business.ftc.gov/documents/Complying-with-COPPA-Frequently-Asked-Questions>, 
the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. COPPA has very strict 
requirements about collecting personal information from children. For 
instance:

   - In order to collect personal information about children (such as the 
   child's name, email address, photograph, or anything else that most sites 
   collect in creating an account), the site must *first* obtain verifiable 
   parental consent. This consent has to come in the form of something more 
   than just email: a credit card used in connection with a monetary 
   transaction; a consent form printed out, signed, and returned by mail, fax, 
   or scan; a toll-free number the parent can call; etc. 
   - The website operator must also provide parents with a way of accessing 
   and reviewing all information collected about the child, and allow the 
   parent to withdraw consent for any further collection at any time.
   
There are many other rules, including specific rules about how privacy 
policies must be displayed and what they must contain, and what website 
operators may and may not do to encourage children to share information, 
but the big ones are the rules about prior parental consent and access.

As you can see, that's a really heavy burden that most website operators 
aren't able to comply with...so most website operators simply don't allow 
children under the age of 13 to create accounts or to give them personal 
information. 

However, remember that it is *always* okay for a parent to create an 
account and submit information *about* his or her under-13 child. That 
doesn't violate COPPA. So if you are a parent and you're interested in 
allowing your child to use a site, you can do so by creating an account for 
yourself, and allowing your child to use it with your supervision. However, 
if you're a teacher and are interested in allowing your students to use a 
site, it's a little harder: you'll need to find COPPA-compliant sites that 
welcome information from children and have the internal facilities to 
receive parental consent.

That said, if you're looking to create a comprehensive list of 
COPPA-compliant websites and give them all the ToS:DR treatment, I'd love 
to help out. I don't think there is such a list yet.

Hannah
