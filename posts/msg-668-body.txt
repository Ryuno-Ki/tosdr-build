i can't check it from here because i'm behind the Great Chinese 
Firewall and don't have access to Google groups. Did you try searching 
for it using the 'search in forum' feature? If not, can someone else 
help Ian find the URL of this topic?

That doesn't really matter since it's an objective and quantifiable 
breach of consumer rights. Their sin consists basically in putting the 
'Your details' page before the 'Select your plan' page in the signup 
pipeline: https://ed.grammarly.com/register/signup/features/?newv=1#

Their pricing page is https://ed.grammarly.com/register/subscribe2/ but 
it is not publically accessible without a cookie. They seem to want to 
hide it from the public. :) For proper transparency, the pricing page 
should be publically accesssible and there should be a link to it called 
'Pricing' or 'Products' or similar, from the home page.
