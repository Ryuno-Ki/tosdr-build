related to the second point of the 'liability and indemnification' 
review policy, since we're on the topic of review policies, i would like 
to add a review policies for jurisdictions:

- it is OK for a service to choose jurisdiction in their place of 
business, even if this means that the service will not be available to 
certain users.

- it is also OK if a service is only available in certain countries 
because of licensing restrictions (example: spotify), or where the 
service is clearly marketed geographically. having said that, we want 
services to be available to users as universally and equally as 
possible.

- it is a plus point if a service has multiple jurisdictions to make it 
more accessible to more people. example: facebook is available in Cuba 
thanks to their second jurisdiction option in Ireland.

- also, it is a pluspoint if a service actively tries to be globally 
available, even if this implies complying with government censorship 
where strictly necessary, for instance Google (regrettably failed) 
attempts to be available in China.
