Title: Tumblr notifies you of price changes to paid services

Topic: user-info

Summary: If Tumblr changes the price of their paid services, they will 
provide reasonable notice of the change by posting through the paid service 
itself, and/or by sending you an email to that effect. If you don't want to 
pay the new prices, you can simply cancel the paid service before the price 
change happens.

Score: 25 (good)
