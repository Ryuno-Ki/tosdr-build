A story about how this can go wrong:
http://www.cultofmac.com/217557/apples-deleting-icloud-emails-that-contain-=
the-phrase-barely-legal-teens/
        After more research, Steven found that under the iCloud terms of
        service, Apple reserves the right to remove any content at any
        time that it feels is objectionable, without telling you that
        they=92re going to delete it. Apparently, =91barely legal teens=92
        falls into that =91objectionable content=92 category, along with
        other phrases we=92re probably not aware of.

Source:
http://www.apple.com/legal/icloud/en/terms.html
        You acknowledge that Apple is not responsible or liable in any
        way for any Content provided by others and has no duty to
        pre-screen such Content. However, Apple reserves the right at
        all times to determine whether Content is appropriate and in
        compliance with this Agreement, and may pre-screen, move,
        refuse, modify and/or remove Content at any time, without prior
        notice and in its sole discretion, if such Content is found to
        be in violation of this Agreement or is otherwise
        objectionable.=20

What do you think? Do you use iCloud? What is it for exactly? Is it only
bad, or is it so bad that it deserves the worst ToSDR tag? ("alert," see
http://tos-dr.info/classification.html)
