No worries, Michiel. It just took some digging. For some reason searching 
for "grammarly" didn't pull up all of the points Robin had created, but I 
eventually found my way to all of them. Taken care of.

I definitely agree about the serious lack of transparency. However, I 
wanted to make sure before curating it. I know that we are a user-rights 
project, but originally I thought just through the realm of ToS. This kind 
of information is definitely important to users, though, which is why I 
brought it up. I'm glad Robin mentioned it to begin with!
