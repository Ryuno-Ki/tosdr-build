"As our site and services evolve, the terms and conditions under which we

offering the Myspace Services under the Agreement or Additional Terms for

Myspace (considerably) updated the TOS on 10 June 2013, 'launched' the new 
site (11 June 2013, 11pm ) from the 'beta' without notice to 'Classic' 
users that the dual log in would be discontinued, and that all user content 
except photos and music would not be included in the new platform.

I'm new here, and I'm not even sure quite where to start, but this looked 
like a reasonable place to do it.
