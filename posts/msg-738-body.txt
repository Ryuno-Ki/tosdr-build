That "Right to know" was actually founded on a number of incorrect ideas, 
namely that people would be willing to take the time out to "comparison 
shop" similar products based on their ToS. They just aren't. My research 
proved it, as did research that I cited in mine. People don't care unless 
there's money involved or if there's some sort of major risk (again, 
usually financial). So that bill was never going to pass, and even if it 
did, based on all kinds of previous research, it wouldn't matter because 
the bottom line is that people don't care enough to be informed. They need 
an incentive. This is on top of the fact that, duh, companies don't want to 
be put in a position where a competitor has access to their ToS.

I'd also like to mention that the quip about "twenty-seventh grade reading 
level", while it might be accurate...there's just so much wrong with 
readability scores, which is how they got that information. Readability 
scores are based on number of syllables, sentence length, and document 
length. They have next to nothing to do with comprehension. A young adult 
novel probably has a higher-than-expected readability score based on the 
ratios of syllables/sentence length/document length, yet I doubt very many 
people have difficulty understanding them.

Contracts are known to use obtuse and ambiguous language; but that is 
actually a characteristic of legal language in general. More people know 
how to recite the Miranda Warning than actually understand what it means, 
and I can guarantee you that it isn't written at a twenty-seventh grade 
reading level. 

So while I like the initiative, I kind of wish they did a bit more research 
before publishing this article. They totally miss the point as to WHY 
people don't read contracts, and act like they would if they were written 
in plain language. Maybe they would be more likely to do so if they were 
written in plain language, but this article seems to consider the only 
problem to be length and readability, but there's actually much more to it 
than that.
As a side note, and I'm seriously just putting this out there for 
discussion, given that our goals seem to be similar, it might be a good 
idea to start a discussion with them on any kind of collaboration. After a 
brief glance, it looks more like they look at paper contracts compared to 
our online services, but still. Anyway, just putting it out there.
