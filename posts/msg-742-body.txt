"So let=92s aggregate. Want to help? Want to be one of the coders to=20
create Yelp for contracts? Go to Faircontracts.org. Get in touch with=20
Theresa. Because, like Lonnie Ray Atikinson raps, =93ain=92t no freedom if=
=20
we ain=92t free of the fine print.=94

i hereby CC'ed them. Hi Theresa! We are a crowd-reading project for=20
fineprint. We focus on online services, but there's no reason not to=20
include offline products like bank accounts etcetera. There is already a=20
fork for API services (basically, the business-to-business instead of=20
business-to-consumer version of online services).

we have been working on this for about a year, and already have=20
hundreds of data point. A data point is "service X has a clause Y in=20
their terms of service, and that is good/bad/neutral". Based on these=20
data points we rate all services from 'class A' (good fineprint) to=20
'class E' (bad fineprint).

We got a lot of press attention in September, and raised about 25,000=20
USD through a crowdfunding campaign. All this money was paid by=20
individuals (and also a few companies), who care enough about this topic=20
to donate money in exchange for a few stickers or a T-shirt. We are now=20
using that money to run the project for about a year, and by that time=20
we will hopefully have an established and proven portfolio of reviews,=20
and will be able to get money for the next year in different ways (for=20
instance from foundations).

We are many volunteer reviewers, plus roughly 1 full-time "curator"=20
(who processes all the data we collect, and guards the quality and=20
consistency of our data points and reviews), and roughly 1 full-time=20
programmer.

We also joined in on the tosback project from eff, which checks=20
hundreds of websites each day to detect if any of them are silently=20
updating their contracts (ref. "unilateral modification by the covered=20
entity to the disadvantage of the consumer without explicit consumer=20
consent after the execution of the contract.")

so, i think we are the crowd-readers and programmers you are looking=20
for, let us know how you want to cooperate! :)

You can read everything about our project on http://tosdr.org/

Michiel
