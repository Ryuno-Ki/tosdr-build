That doesn't seem unreasonable to me, as, if you're buying or selling 
something on eBay, you might need at least that information to start a 
claim if something goes awry. 'Indefinitely' might be a bit more than 
necessary though, as both eBay and PayPal have established time limits on 
filing claims-- -but PayPal does deal with transactions from so many other 
sites now.
