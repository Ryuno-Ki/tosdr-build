Yesterday I was following a presentation of Michiel de Jong on OHM in which 
he stated that Twitpic had sold licenses of the spectacular landing of US 
Airways on the Hudson river belonging to Janis Krums.

I investigated the claim, contact Janis and he stated that he own the 
copyright and that he indeed sold licenses to mediafirms, but that 
according to his believes Twitpic hadn't sold any.

Michiel pointed to the TOS of Twitpic in which they had claimed a 
sublicense to resell all content (mostly photos) that was uploaded using 
the Twitpic service.

Janis doesn't believe that has happened, but in his reply he included Noah 
Everett, the founder of Twitpic. Noah has not yet replied on my question if 
Twitpic has indeed resold any licenses of the picture.

So far the claim of Janis missing out on selling his photo appears to be 
incorrect, but obviously I love to hear/see/read if there is any evidence 
in the claim made by Michiel.
