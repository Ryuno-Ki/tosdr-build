Hi Theresa,

Firstly, I'd like to apologise; upon re-reading what I sent you, I feel I=
=20
may have come across a bit aggressive! It's only because this is what I=20
studied and did my master's dissertation on at Cardiff (and hopefully at=20
some point in the future I'd like to return and get my PhD looking at the=
=20
same issues, but that's neither here nor there at the moment).

Secondly, and more importantly, I wanted to offer my services as an=20
in-persion liaison between Fair Contracts and ToS;DR. I'm from St. Louis,=
=20
and although I won't be stateside until June, as Chicago is only a 5-6hr=20
train ride away, I thought that might be a good idea. Obviously I don't=20
think any of us are 100% sure what this collaboration will turn into, and=
=20
thus what my role as liaison would entail, but considering that we all work=
=20
remotely at the moment, being able to be in the same room at some point=20
would probably be a good idea!

Until June, you're more than welcome to keep in touch via email/skype (I=20
think Google video allows for conference-call situations for free, but I'd=
=20
have to check)/whatever other means you prefer. Looking forward to working=
=20
together!

Best,
Ian

<br>
<br>First, thank you for reaching out! And second, apologies for not having
<br>reached out to you sooner (I learned of you recently and do have you
<br>listed under organizations working on some facet of this problem on our
<br>website <a href=3D"http://faircontracts.org" target=3D"_blank">faircont=
racts.org</a>). I have been working on this for a while.
<br>
<br>And that is why I know that Ian is absolutely right in everything he sa=
ys
<br>below about the research and possible solutions (a blog snapshot cannot
<br>capture the many things discussed so the focus on the legislation may h=
ave
<br>given the impression that those examples were the scope of the solution=
s
<br>proposed by us, but they are not).
<br>
<br>As Rick Perlstein did note - I see consumers having to solve the proble=
m
<br>as an intermediary step in the absence of contract law, courts,
<br>regulators, or the corporate community doing anything at a macro level =
to
<br>solve these problems across multiple industries.
<br>
<br>I view the problem as the outgrowth of a disclosure regulatory paradigm
<br>gone amuck and a tremendous imbalance of power between corporations and
<br>consumers, with American courts favoring corporations under the rubric =
of
<br>contract law as applied to these standard form contracts. &nbsp;And Ric=
k did
<br>note that I don't think it is rational for consumers to have to be the
<br>ones to sort it all out, and be left defenseless in the intervening
<br>absence of broader solutions, without market options, or wronged at the
<br>end of the day like the 92 year old in the nursing home whose estate wa=
s
<br>denied her access to justice in the courts.
<br>
<br>The legislation in Illinois was simply a test case example (not the end
<br>goal solution) which I use to show state and federal regulators and
<br>academicians (The Federal Trade Commission/the Consumer Financial
<br>Protection Bureau/Elizabeth Warren/Rich Cordray, and others sympathetic=
 to
<br>these issues) that even in a "Blue" state with an aggressive and ambiti=
ous
<br>Attorney General, both houses of the legislature and the Governor
<br>Democrats, that it was unlikely for anyone to get even the most basic
<br>reform accomplished....just simple disclosure up front. Indeed, the Pla=
in
<br>Language Task Force set up here in 2009 has yet to meet (and is not eve=
n
<br>fully appointed)!
<br>
<br>I don't think disclosure or even "better" disclosure alone is the end-g=
ame
<br>solution here.
<br>
<br>The Consumer Contract Right to Know Act was an outgrowth of what I saw
<br>happening with the ToS initiative and discussions with researchers in
<br>academia --- there is a focus on online contracts, because those are th=
e
<br>ones most readily available for scrutiny (and some academicians told me
<br>this actually skews the research because what professor wants to spend
<br>time curating a statistically significant sample of contracts that are =
not
<br>online?), and arguably already directed to a more sophisticated/literat=
e
<br>audience or at least those with access to online resources.
<br>
<br>Have you ever tried to obtain and scrutinize nursing home contracts,
<br>student loans, health insurance policies, or payday loans, for example?
<br>
<br>When I started (in 2009) to send out waves of smart and capable law
<br>students to "curate" as you are doing....they would come back quasi emp=
ty
<br>handed because it was hard to even obtain the boilerplate without being
<br>required to first fork over your credit card or an extensive array of
<br>documents so as to engage in the underlying transaction...they were
<br>stymied in just getting access to the terms. &nbsp;I personally have sp=
ent
<br>hours in this quest to see how corporate America treats consumers and i=
t
<br>is appalling. &nbsp;Even industries purporting to regulate at the state=
 or
<br>federal level did/do not have regulators that even require copies of th=
e
<br>terms being given to consumers.
<br>
<br>The online world is way ahead of game in that at least they have terms
<br>available for ToS and Tos;DR to look at....
<br>
<br>That said, I really like your A-E system (as the restaurant hygiene gra=
de
<br>format/model is one of the few to show that it works immediately in
<br>simplicity/comprehension) and we too have developed a variety of symbol=
s
<br>that could be used to apply to terms. &nbsp;There is even some overlap =
of the
<br>terms we are looking at though we are focused more on the terms I
<br>mentioned to Rick, such as those that cut off consumer redress.
<br>
<br>I have also floated the idea of a "fair trade" seal that a certain symb=
ol
<br>means not that the contract is fair, but that it doesn't contain x,y,z
<br>rights-limiting terms; others have suggested having a vanilla/stripped
<br>down consumer protection model contract (say the "A contract" for each
<br>industry, that could be available, and then if you want to contract for
<br>curlicues that expand the seller's rights at the expense of the consume=
r's
<br>rights, those could be sold for less etc. and labeled as the "B" "C" "D=
"
<br>or "E" contract version so that people know that if you want no rights =
at
<br>all, go ahead and buy the E contract. &nbsp;If you don't want grandma t=
o give
<br>up her rights to not be abused in the nursing home, or don't want to wa=
ive
<br>the seller's liabilities for everything, buy the A contract. If it is
<br>labeled and standardized as the "A contract" you won't have to spend fo=
ur
<br>hours with a lawyer reading it.
<br>
<br>There are other ways as well that we could discuss but would entail
<br>changing presumptions in the law, whether these contract terms are
<br>assessed under tort or contract law, and other outcomes, likely to be e=
ven
<br>more glacial than a consumer-based bottom up intermediary solution such=
 as
<br>crowd-sourcing for better information in the meantime...
<br>
<br>Which is why I suggested to Rick the crowd-sourcing idea, and think we
<br>should try to collaborate in any way possible if you are interested in
<br>doing so...
<br>
<br>Are you all overseas? I am based in Chicago, and similar to you, am one
<br>full time person with volunteers trying to be catalytic and leverage at
<br>the federal and state level what can be done to address these problems.=
 &nbsp;I
<br>have also focused on the United States, as that is a big enough problem=
,
<br>but we have also done some research internationally and are looking for
<br>models/solutions that could work across the cyber and non-cyber world a=
s
<br>you noted....
<br>
<br>I don't have the technology skills to make happen what I think should
<br>happen, but I am a lawyer with access to other lawyers/professors and
<br>practitioners working on these issues from various angles, and, perhaps
<br>more importantly, am armed with a desire to find solutions to these
<br>problems to make these transactions/outcomes better for people.
<br>
<br>Do you Skype? Or how do you all communicate and are you the people name=
d
<br>on your website or others too? I have a lot of questions about what you
<br>are doing/have found so far in your project.
<br>
<br>All the best, and thank you again, I am thrilled to meet you and will l=
et
<br>Rick Perlstein know we have touched based prompted by his write up.

<br>aren't. My research proved it, as did research that I cited in mine.
<br>People don't care unless there's money involved or if there's some sort=
 of
<br>major risk (again, usually financial). So that bill was never going to

<br>to be informed. They need an incentive. This is on top of the fact that=
,
<br>duh, companies don't want to be put in a
<br>&gt;&gt; position where a competitor has access to their ToS.
<br>&gt;&gt; I'd also like to mention that the quip about "twenty-seventh g=
rade
<br>reading level", while it might be accurate...there's just so much wrong
<br>with readability scores, which is how they got that
<br>&gt;&gt; information.
<br>&gt;&gt; Readability scores are based on number of syllables, sentence =
length,
<br>and document length. They have next to nothing to do with
<br>&gt;&gt; comprehension. A young adult novel probably has a
<br>&gt;&gt; higher-than-expected
<br>&gt;&gt; readability score based on the ratios of syllables/sentence
<br>&gt;&gt; length/document length, yet I doubt very many people have diff=
iculty
<br>understanding them.
<br>&gt;&gt; Contracts are known to use obtuse and ambiguous language; but =
that is
<br>actually a characteristic of legal language in general. More people kno=
w
<br>how to recite the Miranda Warning than actually understand what it mean=
s,
<br>and I can guarantee you that it isn't written at a
<br>&gt;&gt; twenty-seventh grade reading level.
<br>&gt;&gt; So while I like the initiative, I kind of wish they did a bit =
more
<br>research before publishing this article. They totally miss the point as=
 to
<br>WHY people don't read contracts, and act like they would if they
<br>&gt;&gt; were written in plain language. Maybe they would be more likel=
y to do
<br>so if they were written in plain language, but this article seems to
<br>consider the only problem to be length and readability, but there's
<br>actually much more to it than that.As a side note, and I'm seriously ju=
st
<br>putting this out there for discussion, given that our goals seem to be
<br>similar, it might be a good idea to start a discussion with them
<br>&gt;&gt; on any kind of collaboration. After a brief glance, it looks m=
ore like
<br>they look at paper contracts compared to our online services, but
<br>still. Anyway, just putting it out there.

<br>&gt; i hereby CC'ed them. Hi Theresa! We are a crowd-reading project fo=
r
<br>fineprint. We focus on online services, but there's no reason not to
<br>include offline products like bank accounts etcetera. There is already =
a
<br>fork for API services (basically, the business-to-business instead of
<br>business-to-consumer version of online services).
<br>&gt; we have been working on this for about a year, and already have
<br>&gt; hundreds of data point. A data point is "service X has a clause Y =
in
<br>their terms of service, and that is good/bad/neutral". Based on these d=
ata
<br>points we rate all services from 'class A' (good fineprint) to 'class E=
'
<br>(bad fineprint).
<br>&gt; We got a lot of press attention in September, and raised about 25,=
000
<br>USD through a crowdfunding campaign. All this money was paid by
<br>&gt; individuals (and also a few companies), who care enough about this=
 topic
<br>to donate money in exchange for a few stickers or a T-shirt. We are now
<br>using that money to run the project for about a year, and by that time =
we
<br>will hopefully have an established and proven portfolio of reviews, and
<br>will be able to get money for the next year in different ways (for
<br>instance from foundations).
<br>&gt; We are many volunteer reviewers, plus roughly 1 full-time "curator=
" (who
<br>processes all the data we collect, and guards the quality and
<br>consistency of our data points and reviews), and roughly 1 full-time
<br>programmer.
<br>&gt; We also joined in on the tosback project from eff, which checks
<br>&gt; hundreds of websites each day to detect if any of them are silentl=
y
<br>updating their contracts (ref. "unilateral modification by the covered
<br>entity to the disadvantage of the consumer without explicit consumer
<br>consent after the execution of the contract.")
<br>&gt; so, i think we are the crowd-readers and programmers you are looki=
ng
<br>for, let us know how you want to cooperate! :)
<br>&gt; You can read everything about our project on <a href=3D"http://tos=
