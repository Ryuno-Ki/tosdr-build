Title: Microsoft makes no promise to inform you of requests for your 
information

Topic: law-gov

Summary: Although Microsoft states that they will only disclose your 
personal information in a limited number of ways (such as a lawful request 
for your information), they make no mention that they will inform you of 
this request. This places you at a disadvantage when it comes to defending 
yourself against such a request.

Score: 50 (mediocre)
