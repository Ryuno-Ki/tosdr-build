I'm not really sure how that would be possible based on their terms. They 
will notify you 15 days before the price change, which won't take effect 
until the renewal term. If there is a fixed price on whatever service 
you're using, that price stays the same until the renewal term. 

So, say I'm paying $14.99/month for something. Before the month is 
complete, Microsoft changes the price to $19.99/month. According to their 
terms, I'll be notified via email at least 15 days before the price change. 
So, I have 15 days to decide if I want to continue using that service or 
not. They can't suddenly take $19.99 out of my bank account just because 
they've notified me unless the 15 days have expired.

That's my understanding, anyway. Am I missing something?
