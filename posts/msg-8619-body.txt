Thanks so much, Hannah! I'm writing to the Graphite project from Common 
Sense Media to see if they might want to help tackle this. If they are 
already reviewing apps with a special eye on education, it would be a great 
fit. 

If that doesn't work out, we should definitely team up!

<br>&nbsp;- if you're a parent or a teacher, then you're very concerned

<br>
