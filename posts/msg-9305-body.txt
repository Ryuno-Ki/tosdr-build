https://bitpay.com/privacy-policy

In general was a easily reading Privacy Policy.

*Stanza 1 - How changes in Privacy Policy are treated *

_Line 3-4_: /"The revised version will be effective at the time we post
it. In addition, if the revised version includes a substantial change,
we will provide you with 30 days prior notice by posting notice of the
change on the "Privacy Policy" page of our website."/

Well, the bad is, little but substantial changes could be made without
previous advice, and the good, what they classify as important, will
stay in the page.

*Stanza 2 - **About how they collect information*
=20
_Line 1-2_: "/standard web log information, such as your browser type
and the pages you accessed on our website."/

They say "/standard web log information", but it could be all the info'
our browsers provide them, and this is without creating an account.

_Line 3-5:_ //"you open an account or use the BitPay Services, we may
collect the following types of information://
//- Contact information: your name, address, phone, email, Skype ID
//*and other similar information.*//
//- Financial information: the full bank account numbers that you link
to your BitPay account or give us when you use the BitPay Services."//

No comments here.

*Stanza 3

*/_Line 2:_/*"*//We may also obtain information about you from third
parties such as credit bureaus and identity verification services."/

In other words, they can research about us.

*Stanza 4*

/"When you are using the BitPay Services, we collect information about
your transactions and your other activities on our website or using the
BitPay Services and we may collect information about your computer or
other access device for fraud prevention purposes. "/

They are collecting too much information.

*Stanza 7 - How they use cookies*

/"We also use longer-lasting cookies for other purposes such as to
display your e-mail address on our sign-in form, so that you don't need
to retype the e-mail address each time you log in to your account. //"/

Well they use cookies like other tracker sites...

*Stanza 8 **
*
_Line 1-2:_ /"We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the
information stored in them. You are free to decline our cookies if your
browser permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our
website.//"/

Well, cookies coding is a good thing, and they "let" us deny the store
of cookies.

_Line 2:_  /"We may also collect information about your computer or
other access device to mitigate risk and for fraud prevention purposes. /=
/"/

As I said before, this privacy policy let them collect everything.

*Stanza 9*

/"You may encounter cookies from third parties when using the BitPay
Services on websites that we do not control (for example, if you view a
web page created by a third party or use an application developed by a
third party, there may be a cookie placed by that web page or
application.) "/

That's a very bad thing.

*Stanza 11* *- **How they protect and store personal information*

/"We store and process your personal information on our computers in the
US and elsewhere in the world where BitPay facilities are located, and
we protect it by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural
safeguards in compliance with applicable US federal and state
regulations. *We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data
encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and
files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those
employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.*"/

Well, the part that is in bold is some good but before that, they could
store that information in everywhere, and they use those regulations
from U.S, this is valid for the NSA breakable ones?

*Stanza 13 - How they use the personal information they collect*

/"- provide the BitPay Services and customer support you request; -
process transactions and send notices about your transactions; - resolve
disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems; - prevent potentially
prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our User Agreement; -
customize, measure, and improve the BitPay Services and the content and
layout of our website and applications; - deliver targeted marketing,
service update notices, and promotional offers based on your
communication preferences; - compare information for accuracy and verify
it with third parties. "/

Well, this is quite good, the information they collect (that doesn't
include the third-party cookies) in my see isn't shared with anyone
without a law enforcement.
Someone say contrary?

*Stanza 14 - Marketing*

_Line 1:_ "We do not sell or rent your personal information to third
parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent"

Very good...
_
__Line 2-4:_ "/If you do not wish to receive marketing communications
from us or participate in our ad-customization programs, simply indicate
your preference by logging into your account and going to the Profile
subtab under the My Account tab and adjusting your preferences under
Account Information, or by following the directions provided with the
communication or advertisement."

/So... They let us choice something. Good.
*
**Stanza 14-18**- **How we share personal information with other BitPay
users **
*

To process your payments, we may share some of your personal information
with the person or company that you are paying or that is paying you.
Your contact information, date of sign-up, the number of payments you
have received from verified BitPay users, and whether you have verified
control of a bank account are provided to other BitPay users who you
transact with through BitPay. *In addition, this and other information
may also be shared with third parties when you use these third parties
to access the BitPay Services. Unless you have agreed to it, these third
parties are not allowed to use this information for any purpose other
than to enable the BitPay Services. *

If you are buying goods or services and pay through BitPay, we may also
provide the seller with your confirmed credit card billing address to
help complete your transaction with the seller. *The seller is not
allowed to use this information to market their services to you unless
you have agreed to it.* If an attempt to pay your seller fails, or is
later invalidated, we may also provide your seller with details of the
unsuccessful payment. To facilitate dispute resolutions, we may provide
a buyer with the sellers address so that goods can be returned to the
seller.

We work with third parties, including merchants, to enable them to
accept or facilitate payments from or to you using BitPay. In doing so,
a third party may share information about you with us, such as your
email address or mobile phone number to inform you that a payment is
sent to you or when you attempt to pay that merchant or through that
third party. We use this information to confirm to that you are a BitPay
customer and that BitPay as a form of payment can be enabled, or where a
payment is sent to you to send you notification that you have received a
payment. Also, if you request that we validate your status as a BitPay
customer with a third party, we will do so. Please note that merchants
you buy from and contract with have their own privacy policies, and
BitPay may not be held responsible for their operations, including, but
not limited to, their information practices.

The first bold, well, the synchronizing made with BitPay could let us
some privacy issues, but not at all, see, they don't have access to the
same information as BitPay.
The information that in my vision, is some essential to negotiate with
BitPay is provided to another users, to confirm identity.
The second bold, the seller is limited with our information, good.
