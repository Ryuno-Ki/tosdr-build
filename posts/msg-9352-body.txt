Hi Synamics,

Firstly, thank you for your contribution. We're always glad to have new 
people contributing to the project.

Secondly, however, we ask that you please follow the guidelines here: 
http://tosdr.org/get-involved.html when contributing.

We ask that you create a separate discussion thread for each point you 
make. While this may seem tedious, it keeps the discussions focused and 
allows the curators (like myself) to easily find when a discussion has come 
to an end (at which time the point will be formatted and uploaded to the 
site). If a thread has multiple points and multiple discussions, it's 
difficult to follow and know when the discussion has been concluded.

Best,
Ian

<br>
<br>Very good...
<br>_
<br>__Line 2-4:_ "/If you do not wish to receive marketing communications
<br>from us or participate in our ad-customization programs, simply indicat=
e
<br>your preference by logging into your account and going to the Profile
<br>subtab under the My Account tab and adjusting your preferences under
<br>Account Information, or by following the directions provided with the
<br>communication or advertisement."
<br>
<br>/So... They let us choice something. Good.
<br>*
<br>**Stanza 14-18**- **How we share personal information with other BitPay
<br>users **
<br>*
<br>
<br>To process your payments, we may share some of your personal informatio=
n
<br>with the person or company that you are paying or that is paying you.
<br>Your contact information, date of sign-up, the number of payments you
<br>have received from verified BitPay users, and whether you have verified
<br>control of a bank account are provided to other BitPay users who you
<br>transact with through BitPay. *In addition, this and other information
<br>may also be shared with third parties when you use these third parties
<br>to access the BitPay Services. Unless you have agreed to it, these thir=
d
<br>parties are not allowed to use this information for any purpose other
<br>than to enable the BitPay Services. *
<br>
<br>If you are buying goods or services and pay through BitPay, we may also
<br>provide the seller with your confirmed credit card billing address to
<br>help complete your transaction with the seller. *The seller is not
<br>allowed to use this information to market their services to you unless
<br>you have agreed to it.* If an attempt to pay your seller fails, or is
<br>later invalidated, we may also provide your seller with details of the
<br>unsuccessful payment. To facilitate dispute resolutions, we may provide
<br>a buyer with the sellers address so that goods can be returned to the
<br>seller.
<br>
<br>We work with third parties, including merchants, to enable them to
<br>accept or facilitate payments from or to you using BitPay. In doing so,
<br>a third party may share information about you with us, such as your
<br>email address or mobile phone number to inform you that a payment is
<br>sent to you or when you attempt to pay that merchant or through that
<br>third party. We use this information to confirm to that you are a BitPa=
y
<br>customer and that BitPay as a form of payment can be enabled, or where =
a
<br>payment is sent to you to send you notification that you have received =
a
<br>payment. Also, if you request that we validate your status as a BitPay
<br>customer with a third party, we will do so. Please note that merchants
<br>you buy from and contract with have their own privacy policies, and
<br>BitPay may not be held responsible for their operations, including, but
<br>not limited to, their information practices.
<br>
<br>The first bold, well, the synchronizing made with BitPay could let us
<br>some privacy issues, but not at all, see, they don't have access to the
<br>same information as BitPay.
<br>The information that in my vision, is some essential to negotiate with
<br>BitPay is provided to another users, to confirm identity.
<br>The second bold, the seller is limited with our information, good.
