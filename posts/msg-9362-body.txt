Title: MyKolab is very strict when providing access to Lawful Interception 
requests

Topic: law-gov

Summary: MyKolab is very strict when granting access to a Lawful 
Interception request. All information relating to these requests is 
anonymized by the authorities themselves, and they also provide 
spreadsheets which allow you to control how the request is approved. 
MyKolab also keeps a running total of the number of requests received, 
granted, and denied on their Privacy Policy page. The number for all was 0 
as of August 1, 2013.

Score: 60 (good)
