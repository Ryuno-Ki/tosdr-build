So, this first one is just for this:

https://bitpay.com/privacy-policy

*Stanza 1 - How changes in Privacy Policy are treated *

_Line 3-4_: /"The revised version will be effective at the time we post
it. In addition, if the revised version includes a substantial change,
we will provide you with 30 days prior notice by posting notice of the
change on the "Privacy Policy" page of our website."/

Well, the bad is, little but substantial changes could be made without
previous advice, and the good, what they classify as important, will
stay in the page.

      <br>
      /"- provide the BitPay Services and customer support you request;
      -<br>
      process transactions and send notices about your transactions; -
      resolve<br>
      disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems; - prevent
      potentially<br>
      prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our User Agreement;
      -<br>
      customize, measure, and improve the BitPay Services and the
      content and<br>
      layout of our website and applications; - deliver targeted
      marketing,<br>
      service update notices, and promotional offers based on your<br>
      communication preferences; - compare information for accuracy and
      verify<br>
      it with third parties. "/<br>
      <br>
      Well, this is quite good, the information they collect (that
      doesn't<br>
      include the third-party cookies) in my see isn't shared with
      anyone<br>
      without a law enforcement.<br>
      Someone say contrary?<br>

      *Stanza 14 - Marketing*<br>
      <br>
      _Line 1:_ "We do not sell or rent your personal information to
      third<br>
      parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit
      consent"<br>
      <br>
      Very good...<br>
      _<br>
      __Line 2-4:_ "/If you do not wish to receive marketing
      communications<br>
      from us or participate in our ad-customization programs, simply
      indicate<br>
      your preference by logging into your account and going to the
      Profile<br>
      subtab under the My Account tab and adjusting your preferences
      under<br>
      Account Information, or by following the directions provided with
      the<br>
      communication or advertisement."<br>
      <br>
      /So... They let us choice something. Good.<br>
      *<br>
      **Stanza 14-18**- **How we share personal information with other
      BitPay<br>
      users **<br>
      *<br>
      <br>
      To process your payments, we may share some of your personal
      information<br>
      with the person or company that you are paying or that is paying
      you.<br>
      Your contact information, date of sign-up, the number of payments
      you<br>
      have received from verified BitPay users, and whether you have
      verified<br>
      control of a bank account are provided to other BitPay users who
      you<br>
      transact with through BitPay. *In addition, this and other
      information<br>
      may also be shared with third parties when you use these third
      parties<br>
      to access the BitPay Services. Unless you have agreed to it, these
      third<br>
      parties are not allowed to use this information for any purpose
      other<br>
      than to enable the BitPay Services. *<br>
      <br>
      If you are buying goods or services and pay through BitPay, we may
      also<br>
      provide the seller with your confirmed credit card billing address
      to<br>
      help complete your transaction with the seller. *The seller is not<=
br>
      allowed to use this information to market their services to you
      unless<br>
      you have agreed to it.* If an attempt to pay your seller fails, or
      is<br>
      later invalidated, we may also provide your seller with details of
      the<br>
      unsuccessful payment. To facilitate dispute resolutions, we may
      provide<br>
      a buyer with the sellers address so that goods can be returned to
      the<br>
      seller.<br>
      <br>
      We work with third parties, including merchants, to enable them to<=
br>
      accept or facilitate payments from or to you using BitPay. In
      doing so,<br>
      a third party may share information about you with us, such as
      your<br>
      email address or mobile phone number to inform you that a payment
      is<br>
      sent to you or when you attempt to pay that merchant or through
      that<br>
      third party. We use this information to confirm to that you are a
      BitPay<br>
      customer and that BitPay as a form of payment can be enabled, or
      where a<br>
      payment is sent to you to send you notification that you have
      received a<br>
      payment. Also, if you request that we validate your status as a
      BitPay<br>
      customer with a third party, we will do so. Please note that
      merchants<br>
      you buy from and contract with have their own privacy policies,
      and<br>
      BitPay may not be held responsible for their operations,
      including, but<br>
      not limited to, their information practices.<br>
      <br>
      The first bold, well, the synchronizing made with BitPay could let
      us<br>
      some privacy issues, but not at all, see, they don't have access
      to the<br>
      same information as BitPay.<br>
      The information that in my vision, is some essential to negotiate
      with<br>
      BitPay is provided to another users, to confirm identity.<br>
      The second bold, the seller is limited with our information, good.<=
