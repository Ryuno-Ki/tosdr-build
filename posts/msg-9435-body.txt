Apparently, now whenever you launch your Microsoft account (aka Windows Liv=
e and Microsoft Passport) for the first time, you're then logged on wheneve=
r you sign into the app whenever you're signed into Windows with your Micro=
soft account on that same device. I don't like being signed into multiple a=
pps as a result of signing into one. I feel that leaves you open to all kin=
ds of third-party tracking and whatnot.

There's also a section on using Skype on your mobile device and how the not=
ification services may be provided by a third party. This third party "may =
receive information about the caller, sender of the message and the content=
 of the message as part of providing the service and may use the informatio=
n in accordance with the terms and conditions and privacy policy for the se=
rvice provider."

This is bad. Why does the notification service even have the possibility to=
 receive information about the content of any message sent to me? Scary.

All of the other changes are formatting.
