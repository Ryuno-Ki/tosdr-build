Because everything in Signal is end-to-end encrypted, the Signal service does not have access to any of this data.\r\n\r\nThere are several community-developed open source utilities that are capable of parsing locally stored Signal content. Android users can also help us test a new backup feature that makes it possible to move your local Signal data between devices (Signal Settings > Chats and media > Chat backups).\""
