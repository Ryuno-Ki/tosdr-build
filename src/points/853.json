  "quoteText": "Cookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you browse and use websites and online services.\nThey are widely used to make websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information and assist with service or advertising personalization.</p>\n<p>Cookies are not the only types of technology that enable this functionality.\nwe also use other, similar types of technologies.\nSee below for more information and examples.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>What are advertising identifiers?</strong>\n<p>Advertising identifiers are similar to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the \"Identifier for Advertisers\" (or IDFA) on Apple iOS devices and the \"Google Advertising ID\" on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices.\nLike cookies, advertising identifiers are used to make online advertising more relevant.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Why does Netflix use cookies and advertising identifiers?</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Essential cookies:</strong> These cookies are strictly necessary to provide our website or online service.\nFor example, we and our Service Providers may use these cookies to authenticate and identify our members when they use our websites and applications so we can provide our service to them.\nThey also help us to enforce our Terms of Use, prevent fraud and maintain the security of our service.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Performance and functionality cookies:</strong> These cookies are not essential, but help us to personalize and enhance your online experience with Netflix.\nFor example, they help us to remember your preferences and prevent you from needing to re-enter information you previously provided (for example, during member sign up).\nWe also use these cookies to collect information (such as popular pages, conversion rates, viewing patterns, click-through and other information) about our visitors' use of the Netflix service so that we can enhance and personalize our website and service and conduct market research.\nDeletion of these types of cookies may result in limited functionality of our service.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Advertising cookies and advertising identifiers:</strong> These cookies and advertising identifiers use information about your use of this and other websites and apps, your response to ads and emails, and to deliver ads that are more relevant to you.\nThese types of ads are called \"interest-based advertising.\" Many of the advertising cookies associated with our service belong to our Service Providers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>How can I exercise choice regarding cookies and advertising identifiers?</strong>\n<p>For more information about cookies set through our website, as well as other types of online tracking (including the collection of information by third parties about your online activities over time and across third-party Web sites or online services for online interest based advertising), and to exercise choices regarding them, click here.</p>\n<p>To opt out of interest-based ads from Netflix in connection with an advertising identifier on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media devices, please configure the appropriate setting on your device (usually found under \"privacy\" or \"ads\" in your device's settings).\nYou may still see Netflix ads on your device, but they will not be tailored to your likely interests.</p>\n<p>Netflix supports the following self-regulatory programs, which provide additional privacy choices for interest-based advertising:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the US: Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)</li>\n<li>In Europe: European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA)</li>\n<li>In Canada: Ad Choices: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC) / Choix de Pub: l'Alliance de la publicité numérique du Canada (DAAC)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At this time, we do not respond to Web browser \"do not track\" signals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>How Does Netflix use Web Beacons and other Technologies?</strong>\n<p>Web beacons (also known as clear gifs or pixel tags) often work in conjunction with cookies.\nWe and our Service Providers may use them for similar purposes as cookies, such as to understand and enhance the use of our service, improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site, and understand interactions with our marketing (including email and online ads on third party sites).\nBecause web beacons often work in conjunction with cookies, in many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of web beacons associated with those cookies.</p>\n<p>We use other technologies that are similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL).\nLike cookies, some of these technologies may store small amounts of data on your device.\nWe may use these and various other technologies for similar purposes as cookies, such as to enforce our terms, prevent fraud, and analyze the use of our service.\nThere are a number of ways to exercise choice regarding these technologies.\nFor example, many popular browsers provide the ability to clear browser storage, commonly in the settings or preferences area.\nsee your browser's help function or support area to learn more.\nOther technologies, such as Silverlight storage, may be cleared from within the application.",

    "tldr": "This is probably more of a functional issue than a privacy issue.\nThe Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. If your browser is set to not accept any cookies, you will not be able to use the Netflix service or website."
