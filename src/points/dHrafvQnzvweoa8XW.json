Users should take care of how they handle and disclose personal information by avoiding sending personal information through insecure email. Tinder tells you to refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.",
